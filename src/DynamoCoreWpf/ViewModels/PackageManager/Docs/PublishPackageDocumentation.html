    <h3>Publishing Dynamo Packages</h3>
    <p>
        Dynamo offers a vast number of features out of the box and also maintains an extensive package library, to which the community can contribute, that can significantly extend Dynamo's capability.
        This documentation describes how a user can publish a package from Dynamo.
    </p>
    <p>
        The menu option to publish a package can be found at: "Packages > Publish New Package...".
        Clicking this menu item will open a dialog box that will ask for all the information related to the package the user wants to publish.
    </p>
    <h4>Package Name:</h4>
    <p>
        Name of the package you want to publish. This will appear in the library and on the package manager website.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Description:</b><br />
        The description is a great place to add more details about your package, including listing any exceptions and pre-requisites.
        It can also be used to educate users on what the package does and how it can be utilised into their workspaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Version:</b><br />
        The version field is split into three sections, major, minor and build, which allows you as a package author to upload new versions of your
        package that follow versioning semantics - Users may want to publish more versions for their packages with new and improved features,
        polish some corners which were left out in the first version, or fix a bug.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Group:</b><br />
        This field can be used to specify a group that a package belongs to such as the company/organization.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>External Dependency (optional):</b><br />
        Your package may depend on a host or its API as Dynamo can be integrated with a bunch of different optional
        hosts such as Revit or Civil 3D, so this field can be used to specify which other host(s) your package depends upon.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Keywords (optional):</b><br />
        Some keywords that can be used as tags related to your package. For e.g Generative Design, ML etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Website (optional):</b><br />
        Website that may provide the user with more info regarding the package or the organization/author.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Repository URL (optional):</b><br />
        A link to package's repository that can help users to view or contribute to the package development.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>License (optional):</b><br />
        A license under which the package is released. Default license : MIT.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Package Contents (optional):</b><br />
        This section includes the right sidebar of the dialog box.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Add File:</b><br />
        Select and add all the files that are related to your package; generally the bin folder, binaries and dependencies are added.
    <p>
        <b>Select Node Libraries:</b><br />
    <p>
        Specify which of the files you added to the package are the node libraries. Node libraries contain the types and methods that Dynamo will import as nodes. In general you should mark any assembly as a node library which contains types you wish to import into Dynamo. ZeroTouch, NodeModel, or NodeViewCustomization assemblies should be marked as node library.
    </p>
    <p>
        To load UI NodeViewCustomizations they should be either defined in the same assembly that contains the corresponding NodeModel definitions OR defined in a separate assembly. In either case, the assembly must be tagged as a node library.
        Currently, for assemblies marked as node library that contain NodeModel or NodeCustomization types, all other types will be ignored. For this reason It is important to separate NodeModel/NodeViewCustomization types from types you wish to import using ZeroTouch import.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Publish Step:</b><br />
    </p>
    <p>
        After filling in all the required details you can publish the package locally or online.
        When publishing locally the package will be published in the local root directory,
        whereas while publishing online the package will be uploaded to the package manager.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Anti-virus Scans</h3>
    <p>
        To provide a secure environment to all Dynamo Package users, we have introduced anti-virus scans for new packages.
        When a user uploads a package, it will be scanned for viruses and will only be available publicly once it has been flagged as safe.
        The scan will happen during the package upload process and will not add to the usual duration of 10-15 minutes for the new package to be available online.
        If your package is flagged as infected, the Package Manager search window will display a notification stating that the uploaded package has
        been found to be infected and won't be published online. To make the package publicly available, check the files included with the package
        and upload a new version through the Package Manager.
    </p>
