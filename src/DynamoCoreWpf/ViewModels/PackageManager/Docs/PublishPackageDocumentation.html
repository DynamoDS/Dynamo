    <h3>Publishing Dynamo Packages</h3>
    <p>
        Dynamo offers a vast number of features out of the box and also maintains an extensive package library, to which the community can contribute, that can significantly extend Dynamo's capability. 
        This documentation describes how a user can publish a package from Dynamo.
    </p>
    <p>
        The menu option to publish a package can be found at: "Packages > Publish New Package...". 
        Clicking this menu item will open a dialog box that will ask for all the information related to the package the user wants to publish.
    </p>
    <h4>Package Name:</h4>
    <p>
        Name of the package you want to publish. This will appear in the library and on the package manager website.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Description:</b><br />
        The description is a great place to add more details about your package, including listing any exceptions and pre-requisites. 
        It can also be used to educate users on what the package does and how it can be utilised into their workspaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Version:</b><br />
        The version field is split into three sections, major, minor and build, which allows you as a package author to upload new versions of your 
        package that follow versioning semantics - Users may want to publish more versions for their packages with new and improved features, 
        polish some corners which were left out in the first version, or fix a bug.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Group:</b><br />
        This field can be used to specify a group that a package belongs to such as the company/organization.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>External Dependency (optional):</b><br />
        Your package may depend on a host or its API as Dynamo can be integrated with a bunch of different optional 
        hosts such as Revit or Civil 3D, so this field can be used to specify which other host(s) your package depends upon.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Keywords (optional):</b><br />
        Some keywords that can be used as tags related to your package. For e.g Generative Design, ML etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Website (optional):</b><br />
        Website that may provide the user with more info regarding the package or the organization/author.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Repository URL (optional):</b><br />
        A link to package's repository that can help users to view or contribute to the package development.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>License (optional):</b><br />
        A license under which the package is released. Default license : MIT.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Package Contents (optional):</b><br />
        This section includes the right sidebar of the dialog box.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Add File:</b><br />
        Select and add all the files that are related to your package; generally the bin folder, binaries and dependencies are added.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Select Node Libraries:</b><br />
        Select the node libraries/DLLs from the list of added files.
    </p>
    <p>
        After filling in all the required details user can publish the package locally or online.
        When publishing locally the package will be published in the local root directory,
        whereas while publishing online the package will be uploaded to the package manager.
    </p>
