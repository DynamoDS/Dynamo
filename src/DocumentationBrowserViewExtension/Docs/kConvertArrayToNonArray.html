<h2>Converting array would cause array rank reduction</h2>
<p> This error message indicates that you are using list of lists which is not formatted correctly. For example, using a list like <code>[1,2,3,[4,5,6],7]</code> where the elements are at different levels will trigger this error, but using a list like <code>[[1,2,3],[4,5,6,7]]</code> will not because it is consistently two levels deep.  </p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>To resolve this issue, make sure the list you are passing as an input to your node has consistent levels (i.e., each element can be accessed using the same level of your list). Another option is to use <a href="https://dictionary.dynamobim.com/2/#/List/Organize/Action/NormalizeDepth"><code>List.NormalizeDepth</code></a> which can make your list levels consistent but might not format the list exactly as you want it. </p>
