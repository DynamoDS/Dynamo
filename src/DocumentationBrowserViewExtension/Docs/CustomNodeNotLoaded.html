<h2>Custom Node Not Loaded</h2>
<p>This error message indicates that your custom node has not been loaded. Custom nodes usually come from a specific 3rd party package. If the package is not installed on your computer, Dynamo is not able to find and load nodes originating from that package. Find out more about custom nodes <a href="https://primer.dynamobim.org/10_Custom-Nodes/10_Custom-Nodes.html">here</a>.</p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>To fix this issue make sure that the package containing the custom node you are trying to use is installed on your machine. You can install 3rd party packages from the <a href="https://primer.dynamobim.org/11_Packages/11-1_Introduction.html">Package Manager</a>.</p>

<p>The node might also come from a local package or dll and will therefore not be available in the Package Manager. If this is the case you need to manually load the dll by pressing the “+” sign under the “Add-ons” tab in the library pane, as shown below: </p>
