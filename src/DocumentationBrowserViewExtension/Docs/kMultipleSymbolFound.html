<h2>Multiple definitions found</h2>
<p>This error message means the same method or class name is used in DynamoCore and different Dynamo packages that you are loading for your graph and Dynamo does not know which method or class (i.e., from which package) to use.</p>  
<p>This warning usually happens when using DesignScript in a CodeBlock. For example, if you are trying to Flatten a list in a CodeBlock, you would use <code>List.Flatten()</code>. If one of the 3rd party packages you are loading also have a class called <code>List</code>, you will see this warning.</p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>To fix this error include the full namespace of the function you are trying to use. For example, if you are running <code>List.Flatten()</code> and seeing this error message, try to use <code>DSCore.List.Flatten()</code> instead (DSCore stands for “Design Script Core” and is one of the default packages that comes with Dynamo).</p>
