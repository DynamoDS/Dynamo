<h2>The index is outside the given range</h2>
<p>This error message means that your list does not contain an element at the index position you provided. For example, if your list is <code>[a, b, c, d]</code> – which has elements at indices <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> – and you try to access the element at index <code>5</code>, you will be prompted with an error message as only elements at indices <code>0</code> through <code>3</code> exist in the list. </p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>Make sure the index variable you are using to access elements in the list is greater than or equal to <code>0</code> and strictly less than list size. List indices go from <code>0</code> to list size minus <code>1</code>. This means that if you have <code>10</code> elements in your list and you want to access the 10th element, that element will be at index <code>9</code>.</p>
