<h2>Dereferencing a non-pointer</h2>
<p>This error message indicates that the node showing this error message received an empty value from an upstream node and cannot work correctly because it expected a non-empty value. This can be related to a bug inside the implementation of a node.</p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>Check upstream nodes to see whether they execute correctly – it is common that upstream nodes do not execute correctly and pass empty (i.e., null) values downstream to a node which then displays this error message. Start from the node that is causing this error and work backwards, checking the output of each node until you find the node that is outputting empty values.</p>

<p>Another approach is to use a combination of <a href="https://dictionary.dynamobim.com/2/#/Input/Object/Action/IsNull">Object.IsNull</a> and <a href="https://dictionary.dynamobim.com/2/#/List/Modify/Action/FilterByBoolMask">List.FilterByBoolMask</a> to filter null values from your data, as shown below:</p>
