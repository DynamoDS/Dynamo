<h2>Error opening corrupted file</h2>
<p>This error message indicates that the file you are trying to work with cannot be opened by your version of Dynamo or that the file is unreadable by Dynamo. </p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>Make sure the file you are trying to open was created using the same or a previous version of Dynamo than the version you are running on your computer (e.g., if the file was created in Dynamo 1.X, you can open it with Dynamo 1.X or 2.X, but if the file was created in Dynamo 2.X, you can only open it with Dynamo 2.X or greater).</p>

<p>To check whether the file you are trying to open was created using Dynamo version 2.X, open the file using Notepad (or any other text editor on your computer) and check to see if the file looks similar to this example:
</p>

<img src="images/MessageFailedToOpenCorruptedFile_image1.png" alt="Example of Dynamo version 2 file opened in Notepad" width="500"/>

<p>If it does, your file can be opened only by Dynamo version 2.X.</p>

<p>If you are running the same version of Dynamo as the one used to create the file you are trying to open and still seeing this error, make sure the file is “.dyn” file and not a “.dyf” file or try downloading the file again. </p>
