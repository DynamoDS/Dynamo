<h2>Unhandled exception in Dynamo engine</h2>
<p>This error message typically means that there is a bug in Dynamo code which is causing Dynamo to crash. This is not necessarily related to your graph (or one of the packages you are using) and <a href="https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#filing-issues"><span>submitting a bug report</span></a> can help Dynamo developers fix these issues in a later release. </p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>Saving your work, restarting Dynamo and re-loading your file can help you recover from these errors. In addition, you can try updating Dynamo and the Dynamo packages you are using on your computer to their latest versions, which might already include fixes for the issues you are facing. If you can identify which package is causing issues, you can also contact the package author directly for more information. </p>
