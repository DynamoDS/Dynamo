<h2>Cannot make a PolyCurve from an empty list</h2>
<p>This warning happens if you are inputting an empty list when trying to create a PolyCurve.</p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>The error might be caused by other nodes in your graph. Check upstream nodes to see whether they execute correctly â€“ it is common that upstream nodes pass empty lists downstream to a node which then displays this error message. Start from the node that is causing this warning and work backwards, checking the output of each node until you find the node that is causing this issue.</p>
