<h2>List indices must be numeric</h2>
<p> This error message indicates that you are trying to access an element in a list by using an index value that is not an integer (i.e., a whole number). </p>

<p>Starting with Dynamo 2.0, lists are collections of values where each value in the list can be accessed using only integer index values (index values range from 0 to list size minus 1). </p>

<p>Read more about differences between Dynamo 1.X and Dynamo 2.X (including how accessing elements in a list has changed) here. </p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>Make sure the index value you use to access list elements is strictly an integer (e.g., 2 and not “2” or 2.0). </p>
