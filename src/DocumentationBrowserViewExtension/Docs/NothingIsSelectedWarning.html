<h2>Nothing is selected</h2>
<p>This error indicates that you have not selected anything in a <a href="https://dictionary.dynamobim.com/2/#/Revit/Selection">selection node</a> (e.g., <a href="https://dictionary.dynamobim.com/2/#/Revit/Selection/Action/Select%20Model%20Element">Select Model Element</a> from Dynamo for Revit).</p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>Click select on the node you are using and make an element selection in Revit. To do this, you must switch from the Dynamo window to the Revit (or other host environment) window.</p>
