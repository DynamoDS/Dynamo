<h2>A cyclic dependency exists between two variables</h2>
<p>This warning messages indicates that you are trying to pass the output of a node to the input of that same node. This will create cyclic dependency which is not allowed in Dynamo.</p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>Make sure that you are not passing the output of a node back into the input of that same node. If you need to create a Loop you can use the <a href="https://dictionary.dynamobim.com/2/#/Script/Control%20Flow/Action/LoopWhile">LoopWhile node</a>, <a href="https://forum.dynamobim.com/search?q=Loop%20using%20designscript">create a Loop using DesignScript</a> or create a loop using Python as shown in <a href="https://github.com/Amoursol/dynamoPython/tree/master/concepts">these examples</a>.</p>
