<h2>Error opening file</h2>
<p>This is a generic error message which indicates that the file you are working with cannot be opened by your version of Dynamo. </p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>Make sure the file you are trying to open was created using the same or a previous version of Dynamo than the version you are running on your computer (e.g., if the file was created in Dynamo 1.X, you can open it with Dynamo 1.X or 2.X, but if the file was created in Dynamo 2.X, you can only open it with Dynamo 2.X or greater). </p>
