<h2>Curve join produced more than one WIRE in Polycurve </h2>
<p>This error message indicates that the lines output by a Polycurve node do not form a closed curve.</p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>This might be because the output of the Polycurve node contains null values. Check to see within each list output by the Polycurve node if the curves connect in one continuous line. One way to do this is to hide the geometry preview of all nodes (right click the node or selection of nodes to hide geometry preview) and then <a href="https://dictionary.dynamobim.com/2/#/List/Inspect/Action/GetItemAtIndex"><code>List.GetItemAtIndex</code></a> one list at a time to see. </p>

<p>Also, this error often comes up with Room Boundaries â€“ try using <a href="https://dictionary.dynamobim.com/2/#/Revit/Elements/Room/Query/CenterBoundary"><code>Room.CenterBoundary</code></a> to extract the curves instead.</p>
