    <h2>Dynamo Documentation Browser</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Welcome to the Documentation Browser! Here, you can find out more about nodes, settings, features, and errors—without having to leave Dynamo.</p>
    <h3>What can I find in the Documentation Browser?</h3>
    <p><b>Node information</b>: Want to learn more about a node? Select the node in the workspace and hit F1. This panel will show you information about how the node works, its inputs and outputs, and more. For several nodes, you can also interact with a sample graph showcasing use of the node in context.
    <br />
    <p><b>Node issue documentation</b>: Did you come across an unfamiliar node error or warning? Click the Learn More link in the error/warning tooltip to access more information, instructions to fix the issue, and links to forum discussions. If you don’t see a Learn More link, documentation is not yet available for that issue.</p>
    <p><b>Information about features and settings</b>: Several Dynamo dialogs include question mark icons that you can click to learn more about the feature or setting.</p>
