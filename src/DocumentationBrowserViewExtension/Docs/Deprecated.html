<h2>Deprecated method or node</h2>
<p> The Deprecated warning message means that the authors of Dynamo want to remove this method or node in the future, and you should try to use different methods or nodes to achieve the same functionality. This warning is a way of notifying Dynamo users that the method will be removed in the future without removing it straight away, so that they have time to update their graphs and models.</p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>Try using different nodes to achieve the same functionality. This error message is commonly followed by suggestions of what still available methods to use instead. Please note that it is best practice not to use deprecated nodes or methods.</p>
