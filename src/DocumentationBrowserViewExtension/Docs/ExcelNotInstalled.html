<h2>Excel not installed </h2>
<p>Indicates that Dynamo was unable to locate Excel on your machine. This warning is typically thrown when using the Excel nodes in Dynamo.</p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>To resolve this error, make sure that Excel is installed on your machine. If you do not have access to Excel from your machine, there are other methods you can use to export data from Dynamo (e.g., you can use the <a href="https://dictionary.dynamobim.com/2/#/ImportExport/Data/Action/ExportCSV"><code>Data.ExportCSV</code></a> node which will save your data to a comma-separated values (csv) file). A .csv file can easily be opened in Excel if needed.</p>
