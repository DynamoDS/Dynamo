<h2>Value cannot be null</h2>
<p>This error message indicates that one of the inputs to your node is null (i.e., does not have a have a value). Typically, this error message also indicates which node parameter received a null value.</p>

<h4>How to fix</h4>
<p>The error might be caused by other nodes in your graph. Check upstream nodes to see whether they execute correctly – it is common that upstream nodes do not execute correctly and pass null values downstream to a node which then displays this error message. Start from the node that is causing this warning and work backwards, checking the output of each node until you find the node that is causing this issue.</p>

<p>If the error message indicates which parameter is null, check nodes on that parameter’s upstream path to see whether they execute correctly and pass non-null values downstream.</p>

<p>Another approach is to use a combination of <a href="https://dictionary.dynamobim.com/2/#/Input/Object/Action/IsNull">Object.IsNull</a> and <a href="https://dictionary.dynamobim.com/2/#/List/Modify/Action/FilterByBoolMask">List.FilterByBoolMask</a> to filter null values from your data, as shown below:</p>
