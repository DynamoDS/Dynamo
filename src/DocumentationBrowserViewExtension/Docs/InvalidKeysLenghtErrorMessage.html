<h2>Number of items does not match the number of keys</h2>
<p>This error message indicates that there is mismatch between the number of keys and the number of values passed into your node (i.e., the <code>Keys</code> input of your node received fewer or more items that the <code>List</code> input of your node). In the example below, the list input received ten items, whereas the keys input received only five (i.e., each key must have a corresponding value and vice-versa):</p>

<p>Make sure that both inputs (i.e., both <code>Keys</code> input and <code>List</code> input) on your node have the same number of elements, as shown below:</p>
