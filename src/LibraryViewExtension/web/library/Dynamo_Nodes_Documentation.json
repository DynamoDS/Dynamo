We use a code block with the formula 'x%a==0' to test for divisibility by a second number, determined by a second number slider. This generates a list of boolean values corresponding to whether the items in the random list are divisible by the number determined by the second integer slider. This list of boolean values is used as the 'test' input for an If node. We use a default Sphere as the 'true' input, and a default Cuboid as the 'false' input. The result from the If node is a list of either spheres or cuboids. Finally, we use a Translate node to spread the list of geometries apart.\n\nIF replicates on all nodes AS THOUGH SET TO SHORTEST.
