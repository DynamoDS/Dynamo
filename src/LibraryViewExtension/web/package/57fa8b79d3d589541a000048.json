Converted cures are organised into sublists based on their layer. The node can be used to convert the sets of curves into Revit Model Lines without introducing unwanted CAD LineStyles into your project. For enhanced workflows, each set of curves can be mapped to a LineStyle of your choice using the lineStyleMap input. The node also circumvents the 10,000 Revit element limit for even greater flexibility.\r\n\r\nIf Revit Detail Lines are needed from a CAD link, there is the DetailLinesFromCADLayers node which provides the same level of functionality to suit detailing workflows.\r\n\r\nBoth of these nodes are optimised to convert more curve types than is currently possible with Explode in Revit or Revit.Elements.Element.Curves in Dynamo. Compatible with DWG or DGN Links and Imports.\r\n\r\nAnother first, introduced in v2.0 of BimorphNodes, is the ability to remove duplicate curves using the RemoveDuplicateCurves node. It works on Dynamo curves or Revit Model or Detail curves. Revit curves have optional inputs to deleted duplicates from the document with the ability to select which curves are preserved based on their LineStyle. \r\n\r\nThe package includes nodes to: \r\n- Extract curves from CAD Links or Imports using layer names as filters\r\n- Extract Detail Lines from CAD Links or Imports using layer names as filters\r\n- Remove duplicate curves\r\n- Query layers in CAD Links or Imports\r\n- Report all CAD Links and Imports in a Revit or Family document\r\n- Set the colour and line weight of CAD (layer) Object Styles\r\n- Duplicate Sheets and placed Views \r\n- Renumber and/or rename Sheets \r\n- Extract table data from Schedules \r\n- Create and query LineStyles\r\n\r\nVisit bimorph.co.uk/bimorph-nodes for instructions on how to use bimorphNodes and downlaodable example graphs.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be the first to hear about the latest news and upcoming releases of bimorphNodes, you can follow us here:\r\n\r\nFacebook:  facebook.com/bimorphBIM\r\nLinkedin:  linkedin.com/company/bimorph-bim\r\nTwitter:  @bimorphBIM\r\n\r\nCompatible with Revit 2015+ and Dynamo v1.0+.
