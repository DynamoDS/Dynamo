    <h1>Package Manager</h1>

    <p>The Dynamo Package Manager is a one-stop-shop for browsing, installing, and publishing packages. Access it from the top navigation under <b>Packages > Package Manager</b>.</p>

    <h2>What is a package?</h2>

    <p>Dynamo offers a vast number of features out of the box and also maintains an extensive package library that can significantly extend Dynamo’s capability. A package is a collection of custom nodes or additional functionality. The Dynamo Package Manager is a portal for the community to download any package that has been published online. These toolsets are developed by both third parties and the Dynamo team to extend Dynamo's core functionality, accessible to all, and ready to download at the click of the button.</p>

    <h2>Installing Dynamo packages</h2>

    <p>You can browse and install packages in the <b>Search for Packages</b> tab of the Package Manager. Use the search field to locate specific packages. You can also apply filters and sorting to narrow down the list to meet your criteria, such as a host program or lack of dependencies.</p>

    <p>Version compatibility is depicted via icons throughout the Search for Packages page:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A flag with green checkmark means the version is likely to be compatible with your current version of Dynamo and host program, such as Revit (if using one).</li>
        <li>A flag with a red diamond means the version is likely to be incompatible with your current version of Dynamo and host (if using one).</li>
        <li>A flag with a blue question mark means that compatibility information is not known for the package version. It may or may not work with your setup.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To view more information about a package, click <b>Info</b> or the package’s name. This opens a side panel where you can read a description of the package, find version and license information, and more.</p>

    <p>To install a package, click <b>Install</b> in the search view. If the package author has added compatibility information to their package, the most recent compatible version will be installed by default. Otherwise, the most recent version will be installed, unless you pick another version from the drop-down menu. In the package details panel, you can click <b>Install</b> at the top of a specific version in the Versions and Package Requirements section to install that version.</p>

    <p>To specify the folder where the package will be installed, click the arrow drop-down next to the Install button.</p>

    <p>You can find a list of the packages you have installed in the <b>Installed Packages</b> tab of the Package Manager. On this tab, you can view package files, uninstall packages, and more.</p>

    <h2>Voting for packages</h2>

    <p>If you’d like to express your appreciation for a package author’s work, you can vote for a package that you have installed. Go to <b>Search for Packages > Info ></b> click the <b>heart</b> icon at the top of the package details. This is only available for installed packages.</p>

    <h2>Publishing Dynamo packages</h2>

    <p>The Package Manager allows you to publish packages inside Dynamo. Open the <b>Publish a Package</b> tab to get started with the step-by-step process of publishing a package. The Publish a Package tab asks for all required and optional information related to the package that you want to publish.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Package details</h3>

    <p>On this page, you can add information about the package as a whole as well as the individual version. Only package name, description, and version number are required; all other fields are optional but recommended to help your users locate and better understand the purpose of your package.</p>

    <h4>Package information</h4>

    <p><b>Name (required):</b></p>
    <p>Name of the package you want to publish. This will appear in the library, in package search, and on the Package Manager website. Package names must be at least 3 characters in length.</p>

    <p><b>Description (required):</b></p>
    <p>The description is an opportunity to add more details about your package, including listing any exceptions and prerequisites. It can also be used to educate users on what the package does and how it can be used in their workspaces.</p>

    <p>For version-specific information, it’s more efficient to add a release notes link. Note that compatibility information is added in the next step, so you don’t need to add version-specific compatibility information to the package description.</p>

    <p><b>Group:</b></p>
    <p>This field can be used to specify a group that a package belongs to, such as the company/organization.</p>

    <p><b>Keywords:</b></p>
    <p>Keywords that can be used as tags related to your package, for example, Generative Design, ML, etc. Keywords can help users find your package via search. You can type multiple keywords into the field at once by separating them with a comma, then pressing Enter.</p>

    <p><b>Website link:</b></p>
    <p>A link to a website that provides the user with more information regarding the package or the organization/author.</p>

    <p><b>Repository link:</b></p>
    <p>A link to the package’s repository that allows users to view or contribute to package development.</p>

    <p><b>Copyright holder:</b></p>
    <p>Name of the person who holds the copyright to the package. If left blank, this defaults to your username.</p>

    <b>Version information</b>

    <p><b>Version (required):</b></p>
    <p>The version field is split into three sections, major, minor, and build, which allows you as a package author to upload new versions of your package that follow <a href="https://semver.org/">versioning semantics</a>. Package authors may want to publish more versions for their packages with new and improved features, polish some corners that were left out in the first version, or fix a bug.</p>

    <p><b>Release notes link:</b></p>
    <p>A link to the release notes for this version. You can add a separate link to each version you publish.</p>

    <p><b>Copyright year:</b></p>
    <p>The copyright year for the package. If left blank, this defaults to the year the package was published.</p>

    <p><b>License:</b></p>
    <p>A license under which the package is released. License applies to the latest package version. If left blank, the package will be licensed under MIT.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Compatibility</h2>
    <p>Add compatibility information for the package version. This information will help users find and install only those versions of your package that will be compatible with their setup, reducing potential issues and confusion. When version compatibility information is assigned, users can filter by compatible versions only, and they are notified of compatibility status via icons in the Search for Packages tab.</p>
    <p>To begin adding compatibility information, select whether your package version works in a host program only, such as Revit or Civil 3D; in a host program and Dynamo Core; or Dynamo Core only. After selecting, you’ll see additional UI controls to begin assigning one or more versions to your package.</p>
    <p>For Dynamo Core or a host program, you can use the <b>From</b> and <b>To</b> drop-downs to select a range, or add versions one by one in the <b>Add individual versions</b> drop-down. In the <b>To</b> drop-down, you also have the option to select a wildcard, for example, 2025.x (all versions). This means that the package version is compatible with all versions within that major release.</p>
    <p>As you add versions, you can add them to the <b>All compatible versions</b> table on the right by clicking the <b>Add</b> button in the middle. If you made a mistake, you can remove versions from this table by clicking the x icon on the version tag.</p>
    <p>Package authors can update compatibility information for their Dynamo packages through the Dynamo Package Manager website (<a href="https://www.dynamopackages.com">www.dynamopackages.com</a>). To do this, log in to the website, navigate to the My Packages tab, locate your package, and follow the steps outlined above.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Select files</h2>
    <h3>Add Files/Directory:</h3>
    <p>Select and add all the files that are related to your package. Generally, the bin folder, binaries, and dependencies are added. You can add individual files or folders.</p>

    <h3>Select package files:</h3>
    <p>This section allows you to organize your package contents prior to publishing. After you’ve selected files or folders to add, you can view, remove, or add files on the <b>Select package files</b> page. You can view the folder structure of your selected files in the left panel, and the contents of each folder in the right panel.</p>
    <p>To remove a file from the package, click it and then click the trashcan (remove) icon in the top row. You can also select and remove multiple files this way. To remove entire folders from the package, click the folder and then click the trashcan icon that appears next to it.</p>

    <h3>Select node libraries:</h3>
    <p>Specify which of the files you added to the package are the node libraries by checking the box in the <b>Node Library</b> column. Node libraries contain the types and methods that Dynamo will import as nodes. In general, you should mark any assembly as a node library which contains types you wish to import into Dynamo. ZeroTouch, NodeModel, or NodeViewCustomization assemblies should be marked as a node library.</p>
    <p>To load UI NodeViewCustomizations, they should be either defined in the same assembly that contains the corresponding NodeModel definitions OR defined in a separate assembly. In either case, the assembly must be tagged as a node library. Currently, for assemblies marked as node library that contain NodeModel or NodeCustomization types, all other types will be ignored. For this reason, it is important to separate NodeModel/NodeViewCustomization types from types you wish to import using ZeroTouch import.</p>

    <h3>Retain folder structure:</h3>
    <p>When creating a package, Dynamo automatically reorganizes the package files into bin, doc, dyf, and extra folders. Advanced package authors with complex package folder structures may want to select the <b>Retain Folder Structure</b> checkbox below the package contents preview panel. When this option is enabled, Dynamo won’t make changes to your package folder structure; instead, the package files will be uploaded as is.</p>
    <p>Packages need to be set up in a certain way to ensure they work and to avoid any issues. When in doubt, make sure the checkbox is unchecked to allow Dynamo to set up the folder structure.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Preview files</h2>
    <p>When you are satisfied with your package contents, click Next to see a preview of how the package files will be set up once they are published. This page is view only; to make additional changes to the package contents, go back to the previous step.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Confirm</h2>
    <p>This step gives you a chance to see all package details, compatibility, and files prior to publishing. To avoid accidental changes, options selected in previous steps are read only on the Confirm page. To make changes to them, go back to previous steps by using the Back button or the navigation controls at the top of the page.</p>

    <p><b>Add markdown file path (optional):</b></p>
    <p>You have the option to specify a file path that hosts markdown (.md) documentation for your package in the <b>Markdown Files Path</b> section. Node documentation will appear in the <b>Documentation Browser</b>, available under <b>Extensions</b> in Dynamo’s top navigation menu or by right-clicking a node and selecting <b>Help</b>.</p>

    <p><b>External package dependencies:</b></p>
    <p>Based on the files selected in Step 3, Dynamo detects external package dependencies, which are listed here.</p>

    <h2>Publishing your package</h2>
    <p>After filling in all the required details, you can publish the package locally or online. When publishing locally, the package will be published in the local root directory. When publishing online, the package will be uploaded to the Package Manager to be searchable by other users once it has cleared the anti-virus scan. You will also find it in the <b>My Packages</b> tab.</p>

    <h2>Anti-virus scans</h2>
    <p>To provide a secure environment to all Dynamo package users, we have introduced anti-virus scans for new packages. When a user uploads a package, it will be scanned for viruses and will only be available publicly once it has been flagged as safe. The scan will happen during the package upload process and will not add to the usual duration of a few minutes for the new package to be available online.</p>
    <p>If your package is flagged as infected, the Package Manager search page will display a notification stating that the uploaded package has been found to be infected and won't be published online. To make the package publicly available, check the files included with the package and upload a new version through the Package Manager.</p>

    <h2>Managing your packages</h2>
    <p>You can find a list of your published packages in the <b>My Packages</b> tab of the Package Manager, where you can deprecate packages, publish a new version, etc.</p>

    <h2>Deprecating a package</h2>
    <p>As a package owner, you can deprecate a package. This puts a tag on the package to notify other users that the package has been discontinued and is no longer maintained. Package search by default filters out deprecated packages, though you can apply the Deprecated filter to include them in search results.</p>
    <p>To deprecate a package, locate the package in Package Manager under either the <b>Installed Packages</b> or <b>My Packages</b> tab. Click the Options menu (three dots) and select Deprecate.</p>

    <h2>Transferring ownership of a package</h2>
    <p>Currently, you cannot transfer package ownership via the Package Manager. You can ask the Dynamo team to add an additional owner. Note we cannot remove existing owners, only add more maintainers of the package.</p>
    <p>If you wish to add an account as an owner to your existing package, please send an email to <a href="mailto:dynamoteam@dynamobim.org">dynamoteam@dynamobim.org</a>. Make sure to provide the package name and the account name you wish to add.</p>

    <h2>Deleting a package</h2>
    <p>If you wish to submit a deletion request, please send an email to <a href="mailto:dynamoteam@dynamobim.org">dynamoteam@dynamobim.org</a> with the subject line ‘Package Deletion Request’ and make sure to provide the package name. Once the request is received, a confirmation email is sent to the package author’s email associated with the package. Once the author has approved the request, deletion will occur within 30 days. If the author does not respond within 30 days, a new deletion request is required.</p>
    <p>Please note that deleting a package does not free up the package name for reuse by new packages.</p>

    <h2>Package Settings</h2>
    <p>You can view your package-related settings in the <b>Package Settings</b> tab of the Package Manager, including new package download paths and package/library search paths. To edit your settings, click the Preferences link in the Package Settings tab to access the Preferences panel.</p>
