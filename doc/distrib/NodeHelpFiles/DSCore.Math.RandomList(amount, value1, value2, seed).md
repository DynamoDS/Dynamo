## In Depth
Math.RandomList(amount,value1,value2,seed) produces a random list with the given amount and between the two input values. This node includes an input titled, "seed". A seed is a value that initiates the randomize function (allowing for additional options for each seed input), and allows you to "recall" random values by using the same value for seed.
