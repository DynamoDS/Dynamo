## In Depth
Approximate with Tolerance will create a Nurbs Surface that approximates an input surface. The tolerance input determines how accurately the result will match the original surface. In the example below, we create a surface using a ByPatch node with a close Nurbs Curve as an input. Note that when we use this surface as the input for a ApproximateWithTolerance node, the result is an untrimmed Nurbs Surface with four sides.
