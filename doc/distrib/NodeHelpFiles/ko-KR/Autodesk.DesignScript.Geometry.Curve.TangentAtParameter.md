## In Depth
Tangent At Parameter will return a vector aligned with the tangent direction at the specified parameter of a curve. The parameterization of a curve is measured in the range from zero to one, with zero representing the start of the curve and one representing the end of the curve. In the example below, we first create a Nurbs Curve using a ByControlPoints node, with a set of randomly generated points as the input. A number slider set to the range 0 to 1 is used to control the parameter input for a TangentAtParameter node.
