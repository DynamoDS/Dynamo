## In Depth
`Geometry.ToSolidDef` converts input geometry into a Solid Def JSON file. By using this node, you can share a JSON formatted representation of geometry instead of sending a file.

In the example below, a cuboid is converted into a Solid Def. Copy the contents of the Watch node to use the Solid Def string representation in another graph.
