## In Depth
Ellipse by Origin Vectors creates an ellipse centered on the input origin points. In this case, the XAxisRadius and YAxisRadius require vectors as inputs. The two vectors must be orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. The two vectors will determine the plane of the ellipse. They need not be in the world X and Y directions. In the example, we first create an origin point by generating two random numbers. We then use a unit X and unit Y vector, which are then scaled by number sliders.
