## In-Depth
`TSplineInitialReflection.Plane` reports the plane around which the Reflection is initially performed. 

In the example below, `TSplineSurface.Reflections` is used to query the reflections applied to an input T-Spline Surface. `TSplineReflection.Plane` is then used to return the plane that was used to perform the reflection.
