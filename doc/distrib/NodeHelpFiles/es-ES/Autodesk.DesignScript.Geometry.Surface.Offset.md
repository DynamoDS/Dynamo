## In Depth
Offset will create a new surface that is offset from the input surface at distance specified by the distance input. A positive distance will create the offset surface according to the Normal direction of the surface, while a negative distance will result in the offset on the opposite side of the surface. In the example below, we first create a surface by using a BySweep2Rails node. We then use a number slider to control the distance of the offset in an Offset node.
