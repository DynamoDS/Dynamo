## In-Depth
In the example below, a T-Spline primitive cylinder surface is created. The position and orientation of the cylinder is defined by the Coordinate System in the `cs` input. The `radius` and `height` values set the size of the cylinder. The spans in radial and height directions are controlled by `radiusSpans` and `heightSpans` inputs. The initial symmetry of the shape is specified by the `symmetry` input. If X or Y symmetry is set to True, the value of radial spans must be a multiple of 4. Finally, the `inSmoothMode` input is used to switch between smooth and box mode preview of the T-Spline surface.
