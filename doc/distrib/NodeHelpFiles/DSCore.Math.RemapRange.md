## In Depth
RemapRange will take a list of numbers and produce a linear scaling of those numbers into a new specified range. The minimum value of the original list is mapped to the newMin input, while the maximum value of the orginila list is mapped to the newMax input. The remaining numbers are scaled to maintain the distribution ratio. In the example below, we use a RandomList node to generate a list of numbers to remap. We use two number sliders to control the new minimum and maximum values of the resulting list.
