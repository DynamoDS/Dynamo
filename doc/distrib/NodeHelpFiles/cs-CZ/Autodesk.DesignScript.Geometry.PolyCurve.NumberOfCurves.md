## In Depth
Number Of Curves returns the number of curve segments that make up a given PolyCurve. In the example below, we generate a set of random points and use PolyCurve By Points to create a PolyCurve. If connectLastToFirst is left as 'false', then the number of curves will be one less than the number of points. Otherwise, if we create a closed PolyCurve, the number of curves will be equal to the number of initial points.
