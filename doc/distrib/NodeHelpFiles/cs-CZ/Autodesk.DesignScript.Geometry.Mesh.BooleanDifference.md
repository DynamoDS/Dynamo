## In-Depth
`Mesh.BooleanDifference` takes a target mesh and a tool mesh as input. This node computes the boolean difference by eliminating any overlap between the tool mesh and the target mesh from the target mesh. 
In the example below, `Mesh.BooleanDifference` is used to subtract a `Mesh.Sphere` from a `Mesh.Cuboid`.
