## In Depth
The Rectangle By Corner Points node takes four input points and creates a rectangle from them. The input points must reflect a rectangle form. In this example, two Number Sliders are used to create the Points By Coordinates at the rectangleâ€™s vertices. A similar but distinct Rectangle ByCornerPoints node uses a list of points as the input rather than each input separately. Both nodes are shown in this example.
