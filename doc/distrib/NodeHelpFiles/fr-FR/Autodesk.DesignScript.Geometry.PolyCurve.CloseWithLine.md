## In Depth
Close With Line adds a straght line between the start and end point of an open PolyCurve. It returns a new polycurve that includes the added line. In the example below, we generate a set of random points and use PolyCuve By Points with the connectLastToFirst input set to false to create an open PolyCurve. Inputting this PolyCurve into Close With Line creates a new closed polycurve (and in this case would be equivalent to using a 'true' input for the connectLastToFirst option in PolyCurve By Points)
