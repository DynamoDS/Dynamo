## In Depth
Surface ByLoft with cross sections takes a list of curves as an input. It will produce a surface by lofting between the list of curves in order. In the example below we create two curves, a line and a sine curve. We use List.Create to combine these two curves into a list, which we use as an input for Surface ByLoft. The result is a surface that is lofted between a sine curve on one side, and a line on the other.
