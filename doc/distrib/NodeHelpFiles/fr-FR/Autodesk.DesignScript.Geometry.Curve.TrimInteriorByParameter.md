## In Depth
Trim Interior By Parameter will remove the interior portion of a given curve, based on the two input parameters. This node will output the two remaining exterior parts of the curve as a list of two curves.  In the example below, we use two sets of random numbers to generate a list of points. These points are used to create a Nurbs Curve by Control Points. Two number sliders set to the range zero to one is used for the parameter inputs in a TrimInteriorByParameter node.
