## In Depth
Watertight T-Spline surfaces are geometries that, if submerged in liquid, would not allow any fluid to leak through.
In the example below, the `TSplineSurface.IsWaterTight` node is used on a T-Spline sphere primitive, returning `true` value. This illustrates one of the cases where a T-Spline surface, although open (vertices are not welded at sphere poles), is watertight.
