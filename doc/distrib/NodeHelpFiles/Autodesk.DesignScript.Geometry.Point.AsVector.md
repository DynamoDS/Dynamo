## In Depth
Point as Vector takes an input point and returns a vector with x,y, and z components equal to the cartesian coordinates of the point. This can also be thought of as creating a vector by two points, where the first point is the world origin and the second point is the input point. In the example below, we use PointBySphericalCoordinates to generate a point, then use AsVector to get a vector which we can control using spherical coordinates.
