## 详细
`PolySurface.Fillet` creates a fillet (rounded edge) between the edges of the given PolySurface.

This node is particularly useful for smoothing out sharp edges in a polysurface model, enhancing the visual and physical properties of the geometry.

In the example below, a cuboid is created, converted to a PolySurface and finally rounded off with `PolySurface.Fillet`.
