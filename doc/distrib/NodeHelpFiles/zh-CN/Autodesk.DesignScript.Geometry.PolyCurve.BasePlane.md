## In Depth
Base Plane will return the plane of a planar polycurve. If the curve is not planar, it will give an error. In the example below, we generate a set of random points and use PolyCurve By Points to create a PolyCurve. Because we only used x and y coordinates, the generated polycurve is planar in the world XY plane.
