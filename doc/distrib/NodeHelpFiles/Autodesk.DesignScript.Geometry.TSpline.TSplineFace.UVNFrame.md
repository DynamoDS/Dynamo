## In-Depth
A UVNFrame of a face provides useful information about the face position and orientation by returning the normal vector and UV directions.
In the example below, a `TSplineFace.UVNFrame` node is used to visualize the distribution of faces on a quadball primitive. `TSplineTopology.DecomposedFaces` is used to query all faces and a `TSplineFace.UVNFrame` node is then used to retrieve the positions of face centroids as points. The points are visualized using a `TSplineUVNFrame.Position` node. Labels are displayed in the background preview by enabling Show Labels in the node's right-click menu.
