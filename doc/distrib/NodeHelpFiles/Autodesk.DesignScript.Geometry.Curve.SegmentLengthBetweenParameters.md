## In Depth
Segment Length Between Parameters will return the length of a curve between the input start parameter and the input end parameter, where a value of zero is the parameter at the beginning of the curve and a value of one is the parameter at the end of the curve. In the example below, we use two sets of random numbers to generate a list of points. These points are used to create a Nurbs Curve by Control Points. Two number sliders set to the range zero to one is used for the parameter inputs in a SegmentLengthBetweenParameters node.
