## In Depth
Centroid will return a point that is at the centroid of a solid. The centroid can be thought of as the center of mass of an solid object. Note that it is possible for the center of mass to exist outside the actual solid. In the example below, we use a set of circles to create a Solid ByLoft, and input the resulting solid into a Centroid node.
