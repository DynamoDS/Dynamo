## In Depth
In the example below, a planar T-Spline surface with extruded, subdivided, and pulled vertices and faces is inspected with the `TSplineTopology.DecomposedFaces` node, which returns a list of the following types of faces contained in the TSpline surface:

- `all`: list of all faces
- `regular`: list of regular faces
- `nGons`: list of NGon faces
- `border`: list of border faces
- `inner`: list of inner faces

The nodes `TSplineFace.UVNFrame` and `TSplineUVNFrame.Position` are used to highlight the different types of faces of the surface.
