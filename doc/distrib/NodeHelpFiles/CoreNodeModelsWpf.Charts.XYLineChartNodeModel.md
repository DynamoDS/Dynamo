## In Depth

XY Line Plot creates a chart with one or more lines plotted by their x- and y-values.
Rename the default lines, or change the number of lines, by entering a list of string labels for each line in the labels input.

To determine the placement of each point along each line, use a list of lists containing double values for the x- and y-values inputs.

Each line is colored by default. To assign different colors, insert a list of color values in the colors input.
