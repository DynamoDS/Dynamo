## In Depth
`List.SetIntersection` returns a new list that includes only the objects contained in both input lists.

In the example below, `List.SetIntersection` compares a list of 0 to 9, stepping by 1, to a list of 0 to 18, stepping by 2. Even numbers below 10 are returned because they are contained in both List1 and List2.
