## In Depth
Create a Rectangle centered at the origin of the input plane, with specified width (X Axis length), and length (Y Axis length). In the example, we use the world YZ plane as the input plane. The width specifies the plane X Axis length, which in this case corresponds to the world Y axis, and the length specifies the plane Y Axis length which is this case corresponds to the world Z Axis.
