## In Depth
`List.Count` returns the number of items in the input list or lists.

In the example below, we create a grid of points. We then compare the count of list items before and after the list is flattened. Pre-flattening, `List.Count` returns 11 items (sublists) on the list. Post-flattening, Count returns 121, as all sublists are removed and the points are on the same list level.
