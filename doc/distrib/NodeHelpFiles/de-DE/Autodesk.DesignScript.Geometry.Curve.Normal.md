## In Depth
`Curve.Normal` returns the normal vector of an input curve. The curve must be planar for this node. 

In the example below, we first create a NurbsCurve by using a `NurbsCurveByControlPoints` node, with a set of randomly generated points as the input. We find the normal of this curve by using a `Curve.Normal` node.
