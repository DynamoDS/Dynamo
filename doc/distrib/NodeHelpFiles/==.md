## In Depth
The `==` node is the Equal To operator. If the `x` input is equal to the `y` input, it returns True. If the two values are not equal, it returns False. This node can be used to compare both numbers and non-numbers, for example, strings, Revit objects, geometry, etc.

In the example below, the `==` node is used to determine if the x and y inputs are equal. We use two number sliders to control the inputs to the `==` operator.
