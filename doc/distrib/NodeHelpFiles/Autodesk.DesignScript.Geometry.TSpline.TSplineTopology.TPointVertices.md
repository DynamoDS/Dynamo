## In Depth
In the example below, a planar T-Spline surface with extruded, subdivided, and pulled vertices and faces is inspected with the `TSplineTopology.TPointVertices` node to check if any of its vertices are T-Points.

The nodes `TSplineVertex.UVNFrame` and `TSplineUVNFrame.Position` are used to highlight the T-Points in the surface.
