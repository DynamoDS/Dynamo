## In Depth
Nurbs Curve By Control Points inputs a list of control points to draw the Nurbs Curve and also allows us to control the degree of the curve. We also have the option to close the curve back to the first point in the list. This example generates four random points on the World XY plane and connects them in order in the X and Y directions.
