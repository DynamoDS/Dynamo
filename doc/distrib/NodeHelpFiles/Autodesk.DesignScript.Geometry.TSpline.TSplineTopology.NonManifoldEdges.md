## In-Depth
 `TSplineTopology.NonManifoldEdges` node identifies non-manifold edges from a T-Spline model. A non-manifold surface can only be displayed in box mode until it is repaired. 

In the example below, a non-manifold T-Spline surface is created as a result of deleting faces on a plane surface. `TSplineTopology.NonManifoldEdges` and `TSplineUVNFrame.Position` nodes are used to identify and visualize non-manifold edges.
