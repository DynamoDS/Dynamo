## In Depth
Union will create a new solid by adding one solid to another. The 'solid' input indicates the solid to add to, while the 'tool' input is the solid that will be added. In the example below, we start with a default cube as the solid we are going to add to. We use a series of number sliders to control the position and radius of a sphere, which we use as the tool. If the sphere is intersecting the cube, then the result is a cube with the intersecting part of the sphere added to it.
