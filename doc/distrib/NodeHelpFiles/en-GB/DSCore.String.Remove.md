## In Depth
Remove takes a string as input, and will remove characters from that string starting at the 'startIndex' input. The number of characters to be removed is specified by the 'count' index. In the example below, we start with the string 'Hello World'. Two integer sliders are used to control the startIndex and count of the characters to be removed by a Remove node.
