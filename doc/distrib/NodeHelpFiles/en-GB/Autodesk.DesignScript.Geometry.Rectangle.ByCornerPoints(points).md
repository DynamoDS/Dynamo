## In Depth
The Rectangle By Corner Points node takes a list of four input points and creates a rectangle from them. The input points must reflect a rectangle form. In this example, two Number Sliders are used to create the Points By Coordinates at the rectangleâ€™s vertices. A similar but distinct Rectangle ByCornerPoints node uses four separate inputs for eacher point rather than as a single list. Both nodes are shown in this example.
