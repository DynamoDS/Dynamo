## In Depth
Self Intersections will return a list of all points where a polygon intersects itself. In the example below, we first generate a list of random unsorted angles and radii to use with Points By Cylindrical Coordinates. Because we kept the elevation constant, and did not sort the angles of these points, a polygon created with Polygon By Points will be planar and is likely to be self-intersecting. We can then find the intersection points using Self Intersections
