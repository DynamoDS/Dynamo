## In Depth
ExtendWithEllipse will return an extension of a PolyCurve as a portion of an ellipse. In the example below, a PolyCurve with a single segment is extended into an ellipse. The extension is controlled by two radii, it's length, its end parameter, and whether the start or end of the PolyCurve is being extended.
