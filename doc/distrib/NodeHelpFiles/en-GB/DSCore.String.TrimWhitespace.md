## In Depth
TrimWhitespace will remove all the whitespace of an input string. In the example below, we start with the string '     Hello World     ', which has several leading and trailing spaces. By using TrigWhitespace, we can remove the spaces at the beginning and end of the string, as well as the space between 'Hello' and 'World'.
