## In Depth
Pull Onto Plane will create a new curve by projecting an input curve onto an input plane, using the normal of the plane as the direction of projection. In the example below, we first create a Nurbs Curve using a ByControlPoints node, with a set of randomly generated points as the input. We use the world XY plane as the plane to project onto in a PullOntoPlane node. The result is a planar curve on the XY plane.
