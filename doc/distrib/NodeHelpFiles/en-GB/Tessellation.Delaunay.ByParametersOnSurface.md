## In Depth
`Delaunay.ByParametersOnSurface` returns a Delaunay triangulation of an input surface.

In the example below, a Delaunay triangulation of a NurbsSurface is returned with a UV count of 400. Increasing the UV count will create a better approximation of the underlying surface but with more triangles.
