## In Depth
Read From File takes a file as input. The file should be a text file that has data separated by commas. The different lines in the file correspond to the outer list, while the individual values in each line correspond to the inner lists. In the example below, we first use a File Path node and a File.FromPath node to create a file object that points to a text file. Then we use a ReadFromFile node to create a list from the CSV file.
