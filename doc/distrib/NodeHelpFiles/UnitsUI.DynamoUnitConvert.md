## In Depth
`Convert By Units` converts the input value of a given unit into a corresponding unit in a different unit system. The options available depend on which unit type is selected in the first drop-down. Use the arrows button to swap units from left to right.

In the example, we use `Convert By Units` to convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius. First, Temperature is selected in the first drop-down, which causes only temperature-related options to appear in the two lower drop-downs.
