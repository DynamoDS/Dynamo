Transform will return a new Vector based on an input CoordinateSystem. In the example below, a Vector is transformed from the WorldCoordinateSystem to a new CoordinateSystem defined by spherical coordinates. Try adjusting the sliders to move the new Vector into a different position. Both Vectors are represented as Lines.
