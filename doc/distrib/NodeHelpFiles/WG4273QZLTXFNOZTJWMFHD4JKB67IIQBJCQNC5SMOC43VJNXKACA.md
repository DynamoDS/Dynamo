## In-Depth
In the example below, a cone is created with its base positioned on the origin of the Coordinate System, defined by the `cs` input. The size of the cone is defined by `height` and `radius`. The spans in radial and height directions are controlled by `radiusSpans` and `heightSpans` inputs. The initial symmetry of the shape is specified by the `symmetry` input. If X or Y symmetry is set to True, the value of radial spans must be a multiple of 4. Finally, the `inSmoothMode` input is used to switch between smooth and box mode preview of the T-Spline surface.
