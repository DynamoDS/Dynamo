## In Depth
Surface by Perimeter Points takes a list of points that defines the perimeter of a closed polygon, and creates a surface inside the resulting polygon. In the example below we create a series of points using cylindrical coordinates. The points are created at regular intervals around a cylinder with randomized inputs for the radius and elevation. The resulting list of points is used as the input for a Surface ByPerimeterPoints node.
