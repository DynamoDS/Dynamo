## In Depth
Nurbs Surface By Control Points takes in a two dimensional array of control vertices and outputs a Nurbs Surface. This node also gives us the ability to calibrate the degree in the U and V directions. In this example, a 10 by 10 grid of points is created with a Code Block Range. The grid is then scaled in the Z-direction at random, modulating the output surface from the By Control Points node.
