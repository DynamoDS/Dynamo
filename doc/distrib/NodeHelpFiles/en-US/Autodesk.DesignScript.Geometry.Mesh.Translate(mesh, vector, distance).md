## In-Depth
`Mesh.Translate (vector,distance)` node translates a mesh by a given `distance`, in a given `direction`. 

In the example below, a simple mesh is translated in a direction defined by a vector and represented with a line, constructed from two points. `Line.ByStartPointEndPoint` node is used to visualize the direction of translation.
