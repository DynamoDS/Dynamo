## In Depth
`List.Cycle` takes an input list and returns a new list comprised of the input list repeated a number of times specified by the `amount` input. 

In the example below, we first use a code block to generate a range of numbers from 0 to 5, stepping by 1. We then use a `List.Cycle` node with an input amount of 3. The result is a list with 18 elements, consisting of 3 cycles of the original list.
