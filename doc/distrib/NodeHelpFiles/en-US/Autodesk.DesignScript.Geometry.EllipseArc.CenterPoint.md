`EllipseArc.CenterPoint` finds the center point of an ellipse arc, which is the same as the center point of the completed ellipse. 

In the example below, we first create an ellipse arc by using the XY plane and a series of number sliders. We then use `EllipseArc.CenterPoint` to extract the center of the ellipse.
