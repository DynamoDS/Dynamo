## In Depth
`Unit.AreUnitsConvertible` takes two unit inputs and determines if the first one can be converted into the second one. It returns True if the unit can be converted, and False if it cannot.

In the example below, we use `Unit.AreUnitsConvertible` to first determine if kilometers can be converted to miles. These units are convertible, so True is returned. In the second case, kilometers are not convertible into kilocalories, so False is returned.
