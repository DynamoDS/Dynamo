## In-Depth
In the example below, a T-Spline primitive quadball is created, positioned at a local Coordinate System `cs`, with a given `radius` and divided with the given number of `spans`. The initial symmetry of the shape is specified by the `symmetry` input. Finally, the `inSmoothMode` input is used to switch between smooth and box mode preview of the T-Spline surface.
