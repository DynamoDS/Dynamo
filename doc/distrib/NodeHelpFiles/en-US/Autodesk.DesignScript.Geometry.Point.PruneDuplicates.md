## In Depth
Prune Duplicates takes a list of points as an input, and will return a list with duplicate points removed. The tolerance input is used to determine how close two points need to be to be considered duplicates. If two points are closer than the tolerance, the first one in the list will be kept, and the other point removed. In the example, we generate a set of random points. We then use Prune Duplicates with a tolerance of one to remove any points that are closer than one unit to another point.
