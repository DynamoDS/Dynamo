## In-Depth
`Mesh.Intersect` node intersects the mesh with an input Plane, returning one or more PolyCurves.Â 

In the example below, `Mesh.Intersect` is used on the mesh in the shape of a bunny. The mesh is intersected with a series of input planes to create slices as outlines. This is the starting point for preparing the model for fabrication on a laser cutter, waterjet cutter, or CNC mill.
