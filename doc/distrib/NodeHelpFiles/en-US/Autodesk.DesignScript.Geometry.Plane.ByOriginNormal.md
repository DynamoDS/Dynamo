## In Depth
Plane by Origin Normal creates a plane using the input point as the origin, and perpendicular to the input Normal vector. In the example below, we use a code block to specify the x,y, and z coordinates of a Point By Coordinates. We then use that point as the Origin, and use a world Y-Axis as the normal vector for a Plane by Origin Normal.
