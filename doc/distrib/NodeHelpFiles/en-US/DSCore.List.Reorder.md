## In Depth
`List.Reorder` returns a new list with its items reordered based on a list of indices.

In the example below, a new list is created by manually changing the index order. Each input index assigns a new place on the list for the original list items. For example, item0 is 1, so the first item on the new list is 2.4, which is index 1 on the original list. Item1 is 5, so the second item on the new list is 12, which is index 5 on the original list, and so on.
