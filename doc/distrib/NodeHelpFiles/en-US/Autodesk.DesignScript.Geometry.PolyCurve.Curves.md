## In Depth
`PolyCurve.Curves` returns a list of the individual curves that make up an input PolyCurve. 

In the example below, we generate a set of random points and then use `PolyCurve.ByPoints` to create an open PolyCurve. We then use `PolyCurve.Curves` to generate a list of the individual curves making up the PolyCurve.
