## In Depth
Surface by Patch will create a surface by filling in the interior of a closed curve. In the example below, we first create a closed Nurbs Curve by using a series of points created with cylindrical coordines. A number slider controls the number of points to create, while a boolean toggle node controls whether the Nurbs Curve is closed on not. We use the Nurbs Curve as the input to a Surface ByPatch node, creating a surface on the inside of the closed curve.
