## In Depth
The Point By Coordinates (XY) calls for two number inputs and generates a point on the Dynamo base plane.  In the first example,  we are using two sliders to dynamically control the pointâ€™s X and Y location on the Z-plane. In the second, we are using two Number Sliders and a Code Block Range to determine the maximum extents of the grid and the spacing between points. By changing the Points By Coordinates lacing to Cross-Reference, we can create multi-dimensional set of points along the X and Y axis.
