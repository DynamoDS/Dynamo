## In Depth
In the example below, a T-Spline surface is created by revolving a profile curve, set by `profile` around a given `axisOrigin` in the `axisDirection`. The extent of the revolution is controlled by `startAngle` and `sweepAngle`. The definition is set by `radialSpans` and `axialSpans`. The `uniform` input controls if the spans along the profile are distributed uniformly or taking curvature into account. The initial symmetry of the shape is specified by the `symmetry` input. Finally, the `inSmoothMode` input is used to switch between smooth and box mode preview of the T-Spline surface.
