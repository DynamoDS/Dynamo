## In Depth
`List.SetDifference` returns a new list that includes only those objects from list1 that are not also in list2. 

In the example below, a list of 0 to 9, stepping by 1, is compared to a list of 0 to 18, stepping by 2. `List.SetDifference` returns odd numbers below 10 because they are contained only in List1 and not in List2.
