## In Depth
IsPeriodic returns a boolean value of true if the curve is periodic, and false if the curve is not periodic. In the example, we first generate a number of random points, and then use NurbsCurve ByPoints to create a curve interpolated through the points. We can use IsPeriodic to determine whether or not the curve is periodic.
