## In Depth
The `Not` node returns the opposite of an input Boolean value. The Not node is also referenced as the `!` (exclamation mark) in DesignScript and will convert True to False and vice versa.

In the example below, `Not` nodes are used to swap Boolean inputs to their opposite. The example also illustrates the use of a code block with `!input` to reverse the Boolean.
