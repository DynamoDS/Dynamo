## In Depth
Thin Shell will create a new solid by offsetting the surfaces that make up the input solid. This can also be thought of as thickening the surfaces of the input solid. In the example below, we use a chamfered cube as our input solid. We have two number sliders to control the inner and outer thicknesses of the shell faces.
