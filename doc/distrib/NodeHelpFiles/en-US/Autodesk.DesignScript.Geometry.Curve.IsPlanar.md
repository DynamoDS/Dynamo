## In Depth
Is Planar will return a boolean value that corresponds to whether the input curve is planar or not. In the example below, we first create a Nurbs Curve using a ByControlPoints node, with a set of randomly generated points as the input. We can then test whether this curve is planar by using a IsPlanar node.
