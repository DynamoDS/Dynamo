## In Depth
Ellipse by Plane Radii creates an ellipse centered at the input plane. The xAxisRadius and yAxisRadius take numbers as inputs, and correspond to the X and Y diretions of the input plane, which may be different from world X and Y directions. In the example below, we use a YZ plane as the input, then use two number sliders for the xAxisRadius and yAxisRadius. Because we used a YZ plane, the input xAxisRadius will correspond to the world Y direction, while the yAxisRadius will correspond to the world Z direction.
