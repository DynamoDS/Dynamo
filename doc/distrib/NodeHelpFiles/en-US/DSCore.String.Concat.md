## In Depth
Concat will concatenate multiple strings together into a single string. The number of input strings can be changed by using the '+' and '-' buttons on the Concat node. In the example below, we start with two separate strings 'Hello' and 'World'. They are concatenated together to 'HelloWorld' using the Concat node.
