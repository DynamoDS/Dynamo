## In-Depth
In the example below, to illustrate a case of a non-manifold edge, a surface is produced by joining two surfaces that share an internal edge. A result is a surface that has no clear front and back. The non-manifold surface can only be displayed in box mode until it is repaired. The `TSplineEdge.IsManifold` node is used in this case to highlight which of the internal and border edges qualify as manifold.
