## In Depth
Segment Length At Parameter will return the length of a curve between the start point and the input parameter, where zero is the parameter at the beginning of the curve, and one is the parameter at the end of the curve. In the example below, we use two sets of random numbers to generate a list of points. These points are used to create a Nurbs Curve by Control Points. A number slider set to the range zero to one is used for the parameter input in a SegmentLengthAtParameter node.
