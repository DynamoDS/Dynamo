## In Depth
Point At Chord Length will return the point that is a given chord length from an initial specified parameter. In the example below, we first create a Nurbs Curve using a ByControlPoints node, with a set of randomly generated points as the input. A number slider is used to control the straight-line chord distance to find a point at. A second number slider set to the range 0 to 1 is used to control the initial point along the curve from which the chord distance will be measured. Finally, a boolean toggle is used to determine which direction to measure the chord distance from.
