## In Depth
`List.AllIndicesOf` searches a given list for the given item and returns a list of the indices where that item is found. If no item is found, `List.AllIndicesOf` returns an empty list.

In the example below, we first generate a list of strings, each one a letter between A and D. We then use `List.AllIndicesOf` to search the list for the string B, which is found at indices 1 and 4.
