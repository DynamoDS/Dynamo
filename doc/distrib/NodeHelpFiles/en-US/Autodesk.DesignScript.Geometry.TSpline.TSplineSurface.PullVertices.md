## In Depth
In the example below, all inner vertices of a T-Spline plane surface are collected using the `TSplineTopology.InnerVertices` node. The vertices, along with the surface that they belong to, are used as input for the `TSplineSurface.PullVertices` node. The `geometry` input is a sphere located above the plane surface. The `surfacePoints` input is set to False and control points are used to perform the pull operation.
