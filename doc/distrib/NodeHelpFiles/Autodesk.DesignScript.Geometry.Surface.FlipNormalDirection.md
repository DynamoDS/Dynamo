## In Depth
Flip Normal Direction will flip the direction of the normal vectors of a surface. In the example below, we first create a surface by using a BySweep2Rails. The Normal direction of this surface points up in the positive z-direction. By usinging a FlipNormalDirection node, we create a new surface with the same geometry, but with the normals pointing down in the negative z-direction.
