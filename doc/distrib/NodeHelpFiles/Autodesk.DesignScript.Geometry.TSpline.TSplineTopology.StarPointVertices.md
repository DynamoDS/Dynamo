## In Depth
In the example below, a planar T-Spline surface with extruded, subdivided and pulled vertices and faces is inspected with the `TSplineTopology.StarPointVertices` node to check if any of its vertices are Star Points.

The nodes `TSplineVertex.UVNFrame` and `TSplineUVNFrame.Position`are used to highlight the StarPoints in the surface.
