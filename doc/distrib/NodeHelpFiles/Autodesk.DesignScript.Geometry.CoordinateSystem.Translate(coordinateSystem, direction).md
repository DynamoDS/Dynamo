## In Depth
`CoordinateSystem.Translate (coordinateSystem, direction)` returns a new CoordinateSystem translated by an input vector (direction). 

In the example below, a CoordinateSystem at the origin is translated a certain distance and direction as defined by the input vector of (3.8, 2.7, 0). The new CoordinateSystem is identified with a cylinder created on it.
