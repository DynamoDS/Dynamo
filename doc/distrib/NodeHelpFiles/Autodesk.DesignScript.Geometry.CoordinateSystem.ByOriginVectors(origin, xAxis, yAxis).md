## In Depth
ByOriginVectors (origin, xAxis, yAxis) will return a new CoordinateSystem at an input origin point with input X and Y axes. In the example below, the CoordinateSystem is placed at an origin with new vectors for the X and Y axes. The result is a CoordinateSystem rotated relative to the original CoordinateSystem.
