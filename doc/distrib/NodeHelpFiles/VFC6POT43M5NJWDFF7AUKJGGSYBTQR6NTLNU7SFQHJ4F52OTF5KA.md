## In Depth
`Geometry.Translate (direction, distance)` moves input geometry to a given vector direction. The `distance` input controls the move distance. 

In the example below, a cone is translated along the X-axis. Its distance from the original cone is controlled with a number slider.

In the example below, a cuboid is converted into a Solid Def. Copy the contents of the Watch node to use the Solid Def string representation in another graph.
