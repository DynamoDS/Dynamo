## In-Depth
In the example below, a T-Spline primitive cylinder surface is created. The bottom and top planes of the cylinder are defined by `startPoint` and `endPoint` inputs and the size is set by the `radius` input value. The spans in radial and height directions are controlled by `radiusSpans` and `heightSpans` inputs. The initial symmetry of the shape is specified by the `symmetry` input. If X or Y symmetry is set to True, the value of radial spans must be a multiple of 4. Finally, the `inSmoothMode` input is used to switch between smooth and box mode preview of the T-Spline surface.
