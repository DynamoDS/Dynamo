## In Depth
`Solid.ByLoft (crossSections, guideCurves)` allows us to input a list of guide curves to produce different profiles along the perimeter of a lofted solid. 

In the example below, we use two offset rectangles as the `crossSections`. Two different guide curves are generated around the perimeter, one based on a cosine function, and the other a simple line.
