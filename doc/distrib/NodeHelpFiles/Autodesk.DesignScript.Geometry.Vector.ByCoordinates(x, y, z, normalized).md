## In Depth
ByCoordinates (x, y, z, normalized) will return a Vector from coordinate values and a normalize boolean toggle. In the example below, a Vector is returned with a length of 2.83 that can be normalized to 1. The Vector is represented as a Line to show length change when toggling normalize.
