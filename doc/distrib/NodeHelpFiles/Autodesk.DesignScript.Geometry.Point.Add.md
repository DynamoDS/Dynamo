## In Depth
`Point.Add` adds the x, y, and z components of an input vector to the corresponding coordinates of the input point. This is the same as translating the point by the given vector and is equivalent to using `Geometry.Translate (vector)`. 

In the example below, we create a point using a code block to specify the x, y, and z coordinates, then add a world XAxis vector as the `vectorToAdd`. The result is the point translated by a distance of 1 in the positive x-direction.
