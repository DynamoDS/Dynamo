## In Depth
From Pixels will create an image object from an input two-dimensional array of colors. In the example below, we first use a code block to generate a range of numbers from 0 to 255. A Color.ByARGB node is used to create colors from this range, and the lacing of this node is set to Cross Product to create a two-dimensional array. We then use an Image.FromPixels node to create an image. A Watch Image node can be used to preview the image created.
