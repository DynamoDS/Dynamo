## In Depth
ExtractSolids will return a Solid from a collection of PolySurfaces. In the example below, a Solid is returned from a collection of three surfaces that form a cylinder. Since the node takes a single PolySurface as an input, the three surfaces must be joined together before returning a Solid.
