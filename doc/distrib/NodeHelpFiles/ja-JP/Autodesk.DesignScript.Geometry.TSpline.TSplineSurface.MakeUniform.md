## In Depth
The `TSplineSurface.MakeUniform` node spaces out the knot intervals of a surface evenly. This can come in handy when the surface has bunching after adding control points.

In the example below, a T-Spline surface is created from a NURBS surface using the curvature subdivision method. The T-Spline surface is compared before and after passing the `TSplineSurface.MakeUniform` node.
