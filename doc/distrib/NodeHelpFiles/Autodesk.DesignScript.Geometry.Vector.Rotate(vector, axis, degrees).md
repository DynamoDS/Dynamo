## In Depth
`Vector.Rotate (vector, axis, degrees)` returns a new vector rotated about an input axis by a given number of degrees. 

In the example below, a vector represented as a line is rotated about a Z axis vector. A number slider controls its degree of rotation. Try plugging in different vectors for different rotation axes.
