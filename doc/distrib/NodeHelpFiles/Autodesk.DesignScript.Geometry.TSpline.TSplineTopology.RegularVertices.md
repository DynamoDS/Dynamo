## In Depth
In the example below, a planar T-Spline surface with extruded, subdivided, and pulled vertices and faces is inspected with the `TSplineTopology.StarPointVertices` node.

The nodes `TSplineVertex.UVNFrame` and `TSplineUVNFrame.Position` are used to highlight the regular vertices of the surface.
