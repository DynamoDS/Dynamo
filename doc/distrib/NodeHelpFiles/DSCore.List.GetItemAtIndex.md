## In Depth
`List.GetItemAtIndex` takes an input list and an index (integer) and returns the item from the list found at the given index. 

In the example below, we first use a code block to generate a range of numbers from 0 to 5, stepping by 1. We then extract a single element at index 4 by using a `List.GetItemAtIndex` node.
