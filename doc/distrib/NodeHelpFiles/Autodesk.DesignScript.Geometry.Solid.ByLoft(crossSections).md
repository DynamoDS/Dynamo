## In Depth
`Solid.ByLoft (crossSections)` takes a list of closed curves as an input. It produces a solid by lofting between items on the list of curves in order. 

In the example below, we start with a circle. We then produce a series of translated circles based on a sine curve. This list of curves is used as the input for `Solid.ByLoft`.
