## In Depth
`Cuboid.Width` returns the width of the input cuboid. 

In the example below, we generate a cuboid by corners, and then use a `Cuboid.Width` node to find its width. Note that if the cuboid has been transformed to a different coordinate system with a scale factor, this will return the original dimension of the cuboid, not the world space dimensions.
