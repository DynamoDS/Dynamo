## In Depth

Scatter plot creates a chart with points plotted by their x- and y-values and color-coded based on group.
Label your groups or change the number of groups by inserting a list of string values into the labels input. Each label creates a corresponding color-coded group. If you input only one string value, all points will be the same color and have a shared label.

To determine the placement of each point, use a list of lists containing double values for the x- and y-values inputs. There must be an equal number of values in the x-values and y-values inputs. The number of sublists must also align with the number of string values in the labels input.

To assign a color for each group, insert a list of colors in the colors input. When assigning custom colors, the number of colors must match the number of string values in the labels input. If no colors are assigned, random colors will be used.
