## In Depth

Scatter plot creates a chart with points plotted by their x- and y-values. You can set up labeled and color-coded groups for these points; otherwise, all points will be the same color and have a shared label.

Rename the default groups or change the number of groups by inserting a list of strings into the labels input.

To determine the placement of each point, use a list of lists containing double values for the x- and y-values inputs.

To assign a color for each group, insert a list of colors in the colors input. If no colors are assigned, random colors will be used. The random colors will change each time you make a change to the scatter plot.
