## In Depth
Radius Ratio will find the ratio between the top and bottom radii of the cone. This is equivalent to taking the top radius and dividing it by the bottom radius. In the example below, we create a cone by specifying a start and end point, as well as a start and end radius. We can then extract the Radius Ratio from the cone.
