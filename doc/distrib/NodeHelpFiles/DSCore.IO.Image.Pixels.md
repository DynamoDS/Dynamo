## In Depth
Pixels will return a list of colors from an input image as a two-dimensional array. The Pixels node has two additional inputs to specify the number of x and y samples to use to extract pixels from. In the example below, we read an image using a ReadFromFile node. This image is then input into a Pixels node to extract the pixel colors.
