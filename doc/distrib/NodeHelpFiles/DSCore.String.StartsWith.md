## In Depth
Starts With will return a boolean value based on whether a given string starts with a second input string. By default this node is case sensitive. A boolean value can be used in the 'ignoreCase' input to make the node ignore the case of the strings. In the example below, we use the string 'Hello World' as the original string, and use a second string 'h' as the string to search for. Because 'Hello World' starts with the string 'h' and ignoreCase is set to true, the StartsWith node returns true.
