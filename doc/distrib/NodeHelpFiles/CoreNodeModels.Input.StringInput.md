## In Depth
The String node allows a user to enter a string value. A string can also be created with a Code Block by surrounding the string in quotes. In the example below, we use a String node and a Code Block to create the strings 'Hello' and 'World'. A String.Join node is used to combine the two strings together. A second String node is used with a blank space to act as the separator, resulting in the output string 'Hello World'.
