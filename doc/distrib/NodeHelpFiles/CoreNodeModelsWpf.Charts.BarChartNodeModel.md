## In Depth

Bar Chart creates a chart with vertically oriented bars. You have the option to create a single category or multiple categories by entering a list of string values in the labels input. Each string in the list creates a new category, with its corresponding label.

To assign a value (height) to each bar, enter a list of lists containing double values in the values input. Each list will determine the number of bars, and which category they belong to, in the same order as the labels input. If you have a single list, only one category will be created.

Categories can be color-coded by entering a list of color values in the colors input. A random color will be assigned to each category if color values are not supplied. The random color will change each time you make a change to the bar chart inputs.
