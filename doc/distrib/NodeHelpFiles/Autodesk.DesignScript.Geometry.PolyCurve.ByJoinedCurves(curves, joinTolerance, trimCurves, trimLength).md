## In Depth
`PolyCurve.ByJoinedCurves` creates joined curves from a set of curves with matching vertices. You can determine the permissible size of the gap between curves to be joined with the â€˜joinTolerance` input.

In the example below, a `Polygon.RegularPolygon` is exploded into a curve list and is then rejoined into a PolyCurve.
