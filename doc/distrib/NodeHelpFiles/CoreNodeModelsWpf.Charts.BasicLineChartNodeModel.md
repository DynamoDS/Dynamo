## In Depth

Index-Value Line Plot creates a line chart with one or multiple labeled and color-coded lines plotted along a series of points. The number of string values in the list entered in the labels input determines the number of lines in the chart, along with their corresponding labels.

A list of double value lists entered into the values input determines the position of each point along the line(s). Assign a color for each line by entering a list of color values into the colors input.
