## In-Depth
`TSplineSurface.AddReflections` creates a new T-Spline Surface by applying one or multiple reflections to the input `tSplineSurface`. The Boolean input `weldSymmetricPortions` determines if creased edges generated by the reflection are smoothed or retained. 

The example below illustrates how to add multiple reflections to a T-Spline surface using the `TSplineSurface.AddReflections` node. Two reflections are created - Axial and Radial. The base geometry is a T-Spline surface in the shape of a sweep with the path of an arc. The two reflections are joined in a list and used as input for the `TSplineSurface.AddReflections` node, along with the base geometry to reflect. The TSplineSurfaces are welded, resulting in a smooth TSplineSurface without creased edges. The surface is further altered by moving one vertex using the `TSplineSurface.MoveVertex` node. Due to the reflection being appied to the T-Spline surface, the movement of the vertex is reproduced 16 times.
