## In-Depth
In the example below, a shape with uncreased edges is created using `TSplineSurface.BuildFromLines` node and setting the `creaseOuterVertices` input to False. The vertex with the index 1 is then creased using the `TSplineSurface.CreaseVertices` node and the shape is translated to the right for a better view.
