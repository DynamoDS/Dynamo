## In Depth
`Vector.Scale (vector, xScaleFactor, yScaleFactor, zScaleFactor)` returns a new vector scaled non-uniformly in the X, Y, and Z directions. 

In the example below, two new vectors are scaled from an X scale factor and Y/Z scale factors, respectively. All given scale factors are 2, yet different vector lengths are returned from scaling in different and/or multiple directions.
