## In Depth
`Cuboid.Length` returns the length of the input cuboid. Note that if the cuboid has been transformed to a different coordinate system with a scale factor, this will return the original dimensions of the cuboid, not the world space dimensions.

In the example, we generate a cuboid by corners, and then use a `Cuboid.Length` node to find the length.
