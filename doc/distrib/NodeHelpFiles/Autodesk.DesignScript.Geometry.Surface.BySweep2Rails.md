## In Depth
Surface by Sweep 2 Rails takes an input curve and uses two guide curves to sweep the profile curve along. In the example below, we use a half-circle as the input profile. We create two diverging lines to use as the rail curves for a BySweep2Rails node. The result is a surface with a half-circle profile that grows as the arc moves along the diverging lines.
