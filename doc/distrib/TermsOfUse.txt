Dynamo Package Manager Terms of Service (updated 7/2013)

Welcome to Autodesk! Before using our services, you should read these Terms. By using the service, you (a) are indicating that you have read these Terms, understand them, and agree to be legally bound to them, on behalf of the company or other legal entity for which you are acting (for example, as an employee) (“Company”) or if there is no Company, on behalf of yourself as an individual; and (B) you represent and warrant that you have the right, power and authority to act on behalf of and bind your Company (if any) or yourself (if there is no such entity). A contract is then formed between Autodesk and either you personally, if you access the Service for yourself, or your Company.
If you or your Company (collectively, “You”) do not agree to all of these terms or you do not have the right, power and authority to legally bind your Company or yourself, then (A) do not click “I Agree” but instead click “I Reject” (or other button or mechanism designed to reject these terms); and (B) You are not permitted to access or use the Service; however, any unauthorized use or access by You or Your Company still constitutes agreement and consent to these Terms.
Other Autodesk services You may use may be provided according to different terms of service.  To determine which terms of service apply, see www.autodesk.com/termsofservice.
1.  Services Generally

        1.1      These “Terms of Service” form a contract. They supplement any other agreements You may have with Autodesk, including Additional Agreements and Policies. These Terms apply to many services. Sometimes there may be specific terms or entitlements that apply to a particular service. These are set out in Special Service Terms and Entitlements, the terms of which are incorporated here and are part of the Terms applicable to the Service.  These Terms may use capitalized terms such as “Autodesk,” or “Service.” Capitalized terms are defined in Section 10 (Definitions) or elsewhere in these Terms.  Free Services may be subject to additional terms and conditions that appear in connection with Your use of the Free Services and are incorporated into these Terms by reference.  All payments and fees for the Services are subject to the applicable terms and conditions governing payments between You and Autodesk or a third party authorized reseller or merchant.
        1.2      Autodesk will provide the Services to You and Your Authorized Users. Subject to these Terms, Autodesk will provide the Services and You may access and use the Service and You may permit the Service to be accessed and used by Your Authorized Users provided all such access and use is solely for Your internal business purposes and is in the form made accessible and/or provided by Autodesk. In some cases, access and use by others may be allowed if specifically designated in the Documentation, Special Service Terms or Entitlements.  You will be responsible for compliance with these Terms by Your Authorized Users and any other persons who may have access to the Service through You (whether or not such access is authorized by Autodesk or within the scope of Your Entitlements). Your Authorized Users may be required to review and agree to these Terms before they access and use the Service.  You may not sell or offer to resell the Service Offering in whole or in part. Without limitation of Autodesk’s obligation to provide the Services according to the Entitlements, You understand that certain Services or Service Offerings may not be available in all locations, may require You to purchase a membership or subscription or pay additional fees and may not be available in all languages. You are responsible for administering any of Your own rules for access to Your site or Your Content by Your Authorized Users.  Autodesk is not responsible for enforcing any such rules.
        1.3      You and Your Authorized Users will need to set up an account and maintain Internet access to use the Service.  You and Your Authorized Users will need Internet access and may need to create or log into an account to use the Service and Autodesk reserves the right to require that. You agree that you and Your Authorized Users will not share any user ID or passwords. You agree you will not allow anyone else to access Your account or Your site (except as expressly allowed by these Terms) or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of Your account. You will be solely responsible for arranging and paying any cost for Internet or other network access, equipment, software, services and other resources required for You to access and/or use the Service (“Access”), including, without limitation, Internet service provider fees, telecommunications fees, and the costs of any equipment and third-party software (including, without limitation, encryption and other security technology). Autodesk will not be responsible for the support of Your Access and will not be responsible for the reliability, security or performance of any Access.  Except as otherwise set forth in the Special Services Terms or as described in Your Entitlements, the Services may be accessed on a worldwide basis (although not all services and functionality referenced in the Services may be available in all countries or locations now or in the future). These terms do not change any territorial restrictions applicable to Your use of any Separate Autodesk Product.
        1.4      Service Level Agreements may apply to the Services.  Autodesk will make the Service available to You and Your Authorized Users consistent with the manner in which Autodesk makes the Services generally available to users of the Service. Any SLAs available to You in connection with the Service will be Additional Agreements and the credits (if any) set forth in any SLA will be the sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the identified service levels.  Not all Services have SLAs. Autodesk does not make any representations or guarantees related to uptime or availability of the Service Offering except as specifically identified in the applicable SLA, if any.
2.  CONTENT.
        2.1      Your Content is Yours. You maintain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content and responsibility for Your conduct while using the Service Offering.  You agree that Your Content and Your (and Your Authorized Users) conduct in using the Service Offering will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Rules of Conduct and all other Policies.  By creating, submitting, posting or otherwise making Your Content available to Autodesk and/or others, You acknowledge and agree that: (1) You will evaluate and bear all risks associated with Your Content; and (2) under no circumstances will Autodesk Parties be liable in any way for Your Content as You upload or submit it, including, but not limited to any errors or omissions. Without taking away from Autodesk’s obligation to provide the Services as described in Your Entitlements, You are encouraged to practice effective content retention practices, to maintain copies on Your own computer or local network, to use the latest encryption and other security technology to protect Your Content and to back up and protect the security and confidentiality of Your Content, as applicable to the Service.  Autodesk personnel will not access Your Content except (a) as part of providing, maintaining, securing or modifying Services, (b) at Your request or with Your consent as part of addressing or preventing a service, support or technical issue, or (c) in connection with legal obligations or proceedings in accordance with Section 2.5 below.   Use of Your Personal Information will be as set forth in the Privacy Statement. Autodesk does not own Your Content.  You acknowledge that provision of the Service necessarily involves technical access, processing and transmission of Your Content and Metrics related to use of the Service.
        2.2      What happens when you share Your Content.  Some Services permit You to share Your Content or publish Your Content to a Forum or to other products or services directly or indirectly through other software.  You understand that if You choose to share or publish Your Content (whether by emailing, sharing a link, submitting to a software application for access to a service, posting in a Forum or other public areas or in shared areas available to other users You have chosen, or by any other available sharing mechanism), that anyone You have shared Your Content with (including in some cases the general public) may be able to use, reproduce, manipulate, distribute, display, transmit, create derivate works, and communicate Your Content. Forums may be public and submissions to Forums are non-confidential.  If You do not want others to have those rights, do not use the Service to share Your Content or set Your permissions accordingly. You are responsible for the administration of access to Your Content by Your Authorized Users including granting and terminating access. You acknowledge that in some cases, a user You have granted access to may have the ability to copy or transfer or save Your Content outside of the Service and suspending or terminating access will not delete or inhibit access to content that was earlier copied or transferred.  You waive “moral” rights or other rights with respect to attribution of authorship of Your Content. Autodesk Parties have no control over and shall have no liability for any damages resulting from the use or misuse by any third party of Your Content that You choose to share, directly or indirectly, or any Forum or through any service or software. IF YOU CHOOSE TO SHARE YOUR CONTENT OR MAKE YOUR CONTENT AVAILABLE IN A FORUM OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.
        2.3      Availability of Third Party Materials.  Third Party Materials may be made available to You, directly or indirectly, through the Service (including Third Party Materials shared by other users of the Service, through use of Software that references the Services, through Forums or by any other means). In some cases, such Third Party Materials may appear to be a feature or function within, or extension of, the Services, Subscription, Membership or the Autodesk Software. Accessing such Third Party Materials may cause Your Computer, without additional notice, to communicate with a third-party website—for example, for purposes of providing You with additional information, features and functionality. Such connectivity or access to third party websites or Third Party Materials is governed by the terms (including the disclaimers and notices) found on such sites or otherwise associated with the Third-Party Materials and access to and use of Third Party Materials and other products and services from Autodesk may require assent to separate terms and/or payment of additional fees.. You agree that any viewing, use or access of Third Party Materials by You or Your Authorized Users is at Your sole risk. Under no circumstances will Autodesk Parties be liable for any loss or damage caused by Your viewing, use or reliance on Third Party Materials. Any dealings between You and any third party in connection with such Third Party Materials, including, without limitation, such third party’s privacy policies, use of personal information, delivery of and payment for goods and services, and any other terms associated with such dealings, are solely between You and such third party. Autodesk may at any time, for any reason, modify or discontinue the availability of any Third Party Materials.
           2.4      Deleting Your Content.  If You delete Your Content from the Service, You understand it may persist in backup copies. In addition to Autodesk’s rights to delete Your Content upon expiration or termination of these Terms under Section 8 (Termination), Autodesk has the right (but not the obligation) to delete inactive sites or accounts or purge related content (and all backups thereof), without further notice and without liability for deletion or failure to store such content. Autodesk Parties shall have no responsibility or liability for deletion based on Your settings or actions or inactions or for any failure to delete Your Content.
           2.5      Legal Related Disclosure.  Autodesk may disclose Your information if it is compelled by law to do so, provided Autodesk will give You prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted). You agree and acknowledge that Autodesk may access and disclose Your Content to comply with any legal obligations or governmental or regulatory body request (including subpoenas or court orders), as part of a legal proceeding involving Autodesk Parties or at your request. If disclosure is made at Your request, You may be responsible for the costs of compiling and providing access to such information.

8.  TERM AND TERMINATION.
         8.1   Term and Termination.  These Terms shall become effective on the date You first agree to these Terms by selecting the box indicating that you have read and agree to these Terms or, if earlier, the date You first access or use the Service (“Effective Date”). The term of the Agreement (“Term”) shall extend from the Effective Date until this Agreement is terminated or expires as described in this Section 8. Each of Autodesk or You may terminate these Terms, if the other party is in breach of the Terms and fails to cure such breach within ten (10) days after written notice of the breach. In addition, Autodesk may, as an alternative to termination, suspend the Service and Your access to the Service Offering, and/or other Autodesk obligations or Your rights under these Terms, if You fail to make a payment to Autodesk or a distributor or reseller authorized directly or indirectly by Autodesk or otherwise fail to comply with the provisions of these Terms or Additional Agreements relating to any such Service. Autodesk may also terminate this Agreement if You become subject to bankruptcy proceedings, become insolvent, or make an arrangement with Your creditors. Autodesk may terminate or modify this Agreement if the continued provision of the Services to You or Your users is prohibited by applicable law or as otherwise required by applicable law. These Terms will terminate automatically without further notice or action by Autodesk if You go into liquidation. You acknowledge and agree that Autodesk may assign or sub-contract any of its rights or obligations under these Terms. You may terminate these Terms at any time, with or without cause, effective upon notice of termination provided that (except in the termination as a result of a modification of these Terms in accordance with Section 9.1 below) under no circumstances will You be entitled to refund for any fees paid or credit against fees due in connection with the Service. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Section 8, these Terms shall automatically terminate on the first to occur of (1) the date or end of the term of the Service identified in Your Entitlements, (2) the expiration or termination of an Additional Agreement, (3) the removal of the Service from the Separate Autodesk Product or Your Entitlements, or (4) the discontinuation of the Service by Autodesk.  For all Service Offerings identified as “Beta”, “Labs” or “Pre-Release” or made available as “free” or “trial” or without requirement of payment for a Separate Autodesk Product (“Free Services”) , (a) these Terms may be terminated at any time by Autodesk or by You, with or without cause, effective upon notice of termination; and (b) if no expiration date or end of term is identified in the Entitlements, and neither of the events described in (2), (3) or (4) above has first occurred, then these Terms shall terminate on the first anniversary of the Effective Date. Without limitation of anything in this paragraph, for all Service Offerings accessed as part of Subscription or Membership, these Terms and Your access to the Services will terminate when Your Subscription or Membership (and the applicable Subscription or Membership Program Terms) terminates or expires.
         8.2   Effect of Termination.  Upon any termination of these Terms for any reason, You and Your Authorized Users must immediately cease using the Service. Termination of these Terms does not affect, or give You any right to terminate, any Additional Agreement. Sections 3 and 5 through 10 will survive termination of these Terms for any reason. It is Your responsibility to retain copies of Your Content. Upon termination Autodesk shall have the right to immediately deactivate Your account(s) and suspend access to Your Content and, following the Content Retrieval Period, may delete, without notice, Your Content, if any, and all backups thereof, and Autodesk Parties shall not be liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred by You or any third parties as a result of such deletion.
         8.3   Content retrieval after termination.  Within thirty (30) days following the end of the term of Your Services (“Content Retrieval Period”), You may request retrieval of Your Content from the Services by Autodesk.  Provided You have paid all amounts due in connection with the Service,  Autodesk will, at Autodesk’s election, either (1) grant You limited access to the Service for the sole purpose of allowing You to retrieve Your available Content or (2) make such Content otherwise available to You, each of (1) and (2) at Autodesk’s then-current daily professional services rates.
9.  GENERAL.
         9.1   These are Services that may change.  The Terms may change as well.  Autodesk reserves the right, from time to time in its sole discretion, to (1) modify or release subsequent versions of the Service, (2) impose license keys, authorizations, or other means of controlling access to the Service, and (3) change or discontinue the Service or the products, functionality or services comprising the Service, limit the availability of a Service to any geographic area or language at any time. You acknowledge and agree that Autodesk may at any time make feature or functionality updates to the Service. Autodesk will endeavor to inform You of major changes to the Service (including the Entitlements applicable to a Service Offering).  Autodesk will provide You ninety (90) days advance notice if Autodesk discontinues the Service in its entirety.
