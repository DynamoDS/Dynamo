// NOTE: The following namespace has been updated. This test use to fail in unit 
// test, the reason is that LibG.Managed.dll could not be loaded. That was because the
// right "AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve" callback has not been set to 
// resolve the library path when this test is run.
// 
// Where is "AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve" set? It is the "Setup" 
// class this project which is marked as "SetUpFixture". The "Setup" class is 
// responsible in setting "AssemblyResolve" callback that will eventually help 
// resolving the path to LibG.Managed.dll. But the set-up fixture wasn't called due 
// to the fact that it was residing in a different namespace (Dynamo.Tests) 
// while "NodeSampleTests" resides in "Dynamo.Nodes". So by relocating the 
// "NodeSampleTests" to "Dynamo.Tests" helps NUnit locating the "Setup" class.
