{"file_hash":null,"name":"Invert And Mirror Normalized Values","version":"0.1.5","description":"This node performs some typical functions on a list of normalized values: Invert, Mirror Horizontally & Mirror Vertically. The node inputs expect a list, some booleans (i.e. perform a function or not?) and the number of items in a row of the specified list. A typical use case would be the manipulation of image data after having been processed by a Color Brightness/Hue/Saturation node.","group":"CAAD_RWTH","keywords":["invert","mirror","list","normalized","image"],"dependencies":[{"name":"Increment/Decrement by 1","version":"0.1.1"},{"name":"Normalization","version":"0.1.4"}],"license":"MIT","contents":"Invert And Mirror Normalized Values - Inverts and mirrors (horizontally & vertically) a list of normalized values.","engine_version":"0.6.2.29585","engine_metadata":"","engine":"dynamo"}
