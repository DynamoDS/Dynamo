The spacing of the intersects can be controlled by a function., Horizontal Intersects For Divided Surface by Endpoints - Creates a number of equally spaced horizontal intersects for a divided surface based on the path between between two points. PLEASE NOTE: This node will currently (v 0.6.3) only work correctly if Dynamo project units are set to metric feet., Vertical Intersects for Divided Surface by Endpoints and Function - Creates a number of vertical intersects (reference planes) for a divided surface based on the path between between two points.
