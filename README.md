Dynamo is a Visual Programming language that aims to be accessible to both non-programmers and programmers alike. It gives users the ability to visually script behavior, define custom pieces of logic, and script using various textual programming languages.

Dynamo runs as an addin on top of Autodesk Revit, extending the parametric functionality already provided.

Dynamo has been developed based on feedback from several parties including Arup, KPF, Buro Happold, Autodesk, and students and faculty at the USC School of Architecture.


## Running Dynamo ##

The current version will run on top of Autodesk Revit 2013, Autodesk Revit 2014, and Autodesk Project Vasari Beta 3. 

## Releases ##

###0.7.1###
- Package Manager is Back
- 0.6.3 files will be upgraded to 0.7 format
- Experimental Library Loading
- Stability Improvments
- Revit Element created and Selected during a session will be rememebered in later sessions.
- Visualization Performance improvments

###0.7.0###
This is an alpha quality release which represents a significant refactoring of the underlying code.  There are some notable (temporary) restricitions to the functionality that is available in 0.6.3, and major enhancements to others. To allow users to continue work with 0.6.3 while exploring 0.7.0, this release can be installed side by side with older releases.  

New

- New geometry tools:  Dynamo now has a much more extensive collection of geometric operations that are available in stand alone mode as well as when running in Revit. 
- New scripting interface:  Dynamo now allows for direct input of DesignScript code into CodeBlock nodes.  Please see this document for learning DesignScript syntax and capabilities: http://designscript.org/manual.pdf  
 
 
Temporarily Unavailable Functionality from 0.6.3 (coming back soon!)

- Upgrade:  0.6 Dynamo files cannot be opened in 0.7.0.  We are actively working on the upgrade mechanism
- Package Manager: currently disabled until migration is working
- Recursion in custom nodes
- Revit Element explosion to geometry.  Currently users cannot generically extract geometric information from Revit elements.  However, there are different tools that, on a per elment basis, can extract geometric data.  For instance, After selecting a curve from Revit, a user can look in Revit>Element>CurveElement>Query>Curve to extract the geometry.  Similarly, a Family Instance can be queried for such items as faces, curves, location, etc.  
- Revit Elements created in a Revit session are not remembered in subsequent sessions.  New elements will be created when files are re-opened.
 
 
Known Problem Areas
- You can only load 0.7.0 or 0.6.3 in a Revit session.  You must close Revit before changing from one to the other.
- Visualization can be slow with lots of curvy stuff
- Manually Deleting and recreating Revit elements created by Dynamo can cause element duplication or failure to be re-created when the graph is re-run,
- Search tags are in progress.  If you don't find what you are looking for via search, try browsing.

 

###0.6.3###

March 2014

New

- Dynamo Sandbox:   Explore Dynamo without running Revit or Vasari (see your Start Menu)
- Application level settings for Imperial and Metric Units
- Daylighting with cloud Rendering service sample files

- Convert to Unitzed measures (Length, Area, Volume)
- Explode Node (Solids to Faces, Faces to Edges) 
- Solids from Elements handles lists
- Select All Elements of Type and Category Nodes
- Wall nodes element IDs persist after changes
- Area Node
- Volume Measure node
- Length from Curve Node
- Topography from Points and Points from Topography Nodes
- Last of List Node
- Fileter by Boolean Mask
- Group by Key Node
- Is Null node (for filtering out null values) 
- Explode Node (replaces Explode Solid)
- Python nodes now can take node inputs as functions
- Shuffle List Node
- Select All Elements of Category Nodes
- Divided Path Node updates
- XYZs from Divided path
- Treat curves and edges the same for intersection operations
- Preserve Wall Elements on change
- Improvments to node Help descriptions
- Toolbar shortcuts
- Improvements to Preview bubble display (fades, compact error messages, etc)

Fixes

- More robust handling of null values

## Instrumentation ##
Dynamo now contains an instrumentation system. This anonymously reports usage data to the Dynamo team that will be used to enhance the usability the product. Aggregated summaries of the data will be shared back with the Dynamo community.

An example of the data communicated is:

"DateTime: 2013-08-22 19:17:21, AppIdent: Dynamo, Tag: Heartbeat-Uptime-s, Data: MTMxMjQxLjY3MzAyMDg=, Priority: Info, SessionID: 3fd39f21-1c3f-4cf3-8cdd-f46ca5dde636, UserID: 2ac95f29-a912-49a8-8fb5-e2d287683d94"

The Data is Base64 encoded. For example, the data field above ('MTMxMjQxLjY3MzAyMDg=') decodes to: '131241.6730208' This represents the number of seconds that the instance of Dynamo has been running. 

The UserID is randomly generated when the application is first run. The SessionID is randomly generated each time Dynamo is opened.
