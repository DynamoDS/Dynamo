#Visual Programming for BIM#

## Description ##
Dynamo extends the parametric functionality of Autodesk Revit. Dynamo aims to be accessible to both non-programmers and the programmers alike with the ability to visually script behavior, define custom nodes, and script using Python.

## Instrumentation ##
Dynamo now contains an instrumentation system. This anonymously reports usage data to the Dynamo team that will be used to enhance the usability the product. Aggregated summaries of the data will be shared back with the Dynamo community.

An example of the data communicated is:

"DateTime: 2013-08-22 19:17:21, AppIdent: Dynamo, Tag: Heartbeat-Uptime-s, Data: MTMxMjQxLjY3MzAyMDg=, Priority: Info, SessionID: 3fd39f21-1c3f-4cf3-8cdd-f46ca5dde636, UserID: 2ac95f29-a912-49a8-8fb5-e2d287683d94"

The Data is Base64 encoded. For example, the data field above ('MTMxMjQxLjY3MzAyMDg=') decodes to: '131241.6730208' This represents the number of seconds that the instance of Dynamo has been running. 

The UserID is randomly generated when the application is first run. The SessionID is randomly generated each time Dynamo is opened.
