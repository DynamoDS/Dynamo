## Develop ###
### Create a Node Library for Dynamo ###
If you're interested in developing a Node library for Dynamo, the easiest place to start is by browsing the [DynamoSamples](https://github.com/DynamoDS/DynamoSamples).  
These samples use the [Dynamo NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=DynamoVisualProgramming) which can be installed using the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio.

[Documentation of the Dynamo API]( http://dynamods.github.io/DynamoAPI) with a searchable index of public API calls for core functionality. This will be expanded to include regular nodes and Revit functionality.

The [API Changes](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/API-Changes) document explains changes made to the Dynamo API with every version.

You can learn more about developing libraries for Dynamo on the [Dynamo wiki](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Zero-Touch-Plugin-Development).

### Build Dynamo from Source ###
You will need the following to build Dynamo:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
- [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.
- Microsoft DirectX (install from %GitHub%\Dynamo\tools\install\Extra\DirectX\DXSETUP.exe)

Directions for building Dynamo on other platforms (e.g. Linux or OS X) can be found [here](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Dynamo-on-Linux,-Mac).  

Find more about how to build Dynamo at our [wiki](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki).


## Contribute ##

Dynamo is an open-source project and would be nothing without its community.  You can make suggestions or track and submit bugs via [Github issues](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/issues).  You can submit your own code to the Dynamo project via a Github [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).


## Releases ##

### 1.1.0 ###

New Functionality : 
- A whole new bunch of Library added for T-Spline Nodes. You can turn on this option from Settings to view the T-Spline nodes in Library. T-Splines modelling technology is now exposed in Dynamo to enable new organic and freeform geometry creation tools. There are approximately 150 new nodes that are a subset of the existing geometry library. Since this is an advanced functionality that may be useful only in certain non-standard workflows these nodes by default will be hidden in the library and will not interfere in node search results unless explicitly turned on in the Settings -> Experimental menu. The new functionality offers a wide range of capabilities to create and edit T-Spline surfaces and also conversion to and from NURBS and meshes.
- New notification center provides you with more details on system crashes and errors, such as when DLL incompatibilities between Dynamo and other Revit Addins are detected at startup
- New Settings menu option to Show or Hide Preview Bubbles
- We have fixed the long pending issue of Screen Capture, now it doesn't matter how big your graph is, everything will be visible  at whatever zoom level you are at when you use Export Workspace as Image.

Important Bug Fixes: 
- Element Binding (the ability of Dynamo to track and modify rather than duplicate or replace elements in Revit) had some regressions in Revit 2017.  These are fixed.
- Freeze does not delete elements created in Revit anymore.
- Fixed issue related to FamilyInstance.SetRotation, now you can use this node with Run Automatic mode as well and your first instance won't get placed randomly in a different location and crash issues have been addressed
- Fixed long pending issue with Importing series of Swept Solids, Now while after importing all Surfaces are there. 
- Localization crash fixes with Norwegian, German and French
- Dynamo for Revit no longer crashes at startup with non-compliant Views (not 3D)
- When selecting any labeled item only that item's label gets displayed, no additional labels are displayed
- Fixed errors on Code Block Nodes and String Nodes that are published to Web and accessed from the Customizer view
- Read-only nodes and directories can now be loaded in Dynamo.
- Mapping flatten nodes and flatten on single values no longer replaces data with null values
- Arc.ByStartPointEndPointStartTangent no longer fails using a normalised vector
- Direct Shape now recognizes material input properly
-  /verysilent install of Dynamo for Revit now completes without user interaction
-  Fixed crash with closed curve as input to Surface.ByLoft
-  Dot product no longer returning erroneus scalars
-  Zero radius and related bad geometry errors no longer create crash 
-  Turning off "Revit Background Preview" no longer turns off "Background Preview" on relaunch of Dynamo.
 
Other Changes: 
- Now once you add a new path for Package location then all the packages from the new path will get loaded without relaunching Dynamo.
- We have improved the preview bubble for its Pin and hover over related issues.
- Updated the compact view of the preview bubble to display information about the number of items in an output list.
- Quick Access to "Getting Started" from Help menu
- From this release, we stopped migrating of 0.6.3 and 0.7.0 files. If your old files contain nodes from above two releases then you have to open those files on an earlier version (till 1.0.0) and the save them. 

Known Issues:
- Installing Dynamo 4 Revit 1.1 Will require a reinstallation of Dynamo Studio with Studio 1.1 (1.0 and 1.1 cannot co-habitate).  This issue will not happen in the future, when Future Dynamo Core installation will work with older versions of Products. 
- Simplification of some overload methods will result in minor changes in behavior.  Please see this document for specific nodes affected: https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Dynamo-Node-Changes

### 1.0.0 ###

- API Stabilization:  1.0.0 is a commitment to stable code that allows for smoother and more reliable movements from one version to another.  To more clearly express this, we have been moving to “semantic versioning” to illustrate the nature of changes in each release. We will be using the fairly standard version naming with an x.y.z system, where x incrementing represents breaks to the API (requiring developer refactors), y indicates changes that are still backwards compatible, and z are smaller bug fixes.  Package creators and maintainers are encouraged to assess changes to the previous code, which can be found here  

  https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Dynamo-Node-Changes  

  https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/API-Changes
- Graphics performance enhancements:  see this post for details  
  https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/pull/6356
- Documentation: Along with new sections of the DynamoPrimer (http://DynamoPrimer.com), we have started an online documentation of the Dynamo API with a searchable index of public API calls for core functionality. This will be expanded to include regular nodes and Revit functionality.  http://dynamods.github.io/DynamoAPI/
- Licensing:  Dynamo Studio is now using a new version of the Autodesk installer that allows for easier access to network and token flex licensing tools
- Install:  we have created a separate installation for "core" Dynamo functionality, those tools used by all implementations of Dynamo, and Revit, and Studio installations.  This allows for the sharing of a common core of Dynamo code and packages.
- List Management:  Changes to "replication" or automated matching of different data streams in nodes and Code Block nodes eliminates the need for List.Map and List.Combine in many situations
- Send to Web: formerly known as Share Workspace, we have improved the ability to view and interact with Dynamo online with Customizers
- File Export:  Users can now author DWG files in the Translation section of Dynamo Studio.
- Direct Shape:  Dynamo in Revit 2017 can now take advantage of faster and more sophisticated direct shape creation.  In most cases, solid and surface geometry can be sent directly into the Revit environment as smooth (rather than tesselated) surfaces and solids, categorized to whatever is needed.  In the cases where a smooth element cannot be created, a tesselated (mesh) object is created, as was the case previously.

### 0.9.1 ###

Dynamo Core
- Direct manipulation: Sometimes numerical manipulation isn’t the right approach. Now you can manually push and pull Point geometry when in navigating in the background 3d preview.
- Freeze Functionality: When you have long running portions of your graph, or don’t want to export data to other applications, or want to debug some logic, don’t unplug your nodes. Now you can suspend execution of specified nodes in the graph by using Freeze in the right-click contextual menu
- Search Enhancements: Only look at the node libraries you want to with new filtering tools.  See more options at once by using a compact view, or get more information with the detail view.
- Zoom re-center: Select a node, then zoom and recenter your orbit on it in the 3d Preview Navigation
- CNtrl-drag:  Copy/Paste nodes in a familiar way
- Add comments to custom node inputs and full default states for complex data types
- More forgiving DesignScript syntax:  Users can now write instance methods (ex. MyCurve.PointAtParameter(0.5)) as Static Methods (ex. - Curve.PointAtParameter(MyCurve, 0.5))

Known issues
- No backwards compatibility with 0.9.0 and before. This is due to neccessary changes to the Dynamo API in advance of 1.0. These changes can be found in the [API Changes](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/API-Changes) document
- In some situations, placement of Adaptive components requires a change in list structure.  The AC placement nodes now expect to receive lists of lists of placement coordinates.  In the past, the nodes expected to only place one AC, now it expects to place many. If you are going to only place a single component, it needs to be nesting into a list.
- With Win10 the Dynamo Background Preview is blank. If your Win10 workstation contains a graphics card that used to work with Dynamo running Win7 or 8 and you experience an inability to render graphics you may wish to consult:

  https://github.com/helix-toolkit/helix-toolkit/issues/257#issuecomment-194145932

Dynamo Studio
- Share your work online:  Share interactive parametric models online.  Just publish your Dynamo graph and send a link to your colleagues or the whole world.  People can view and interact with your designs in a regular web browser with no Dynamo installed
- ImportExport: Read directly from DWG files and only pull out those pieces of the file that you want.  
- When a user downloads a dyn from the Customizer (or Shared Workspace), the dyn's Run setting is automatically set to "Manual". This may be confusing to some users when they open the dyn in Dynamo and see all Nulls in the outputs: simply click the Run button.
- Users have been reporting that the Customizer (Shared Workspaces) functionality is missing in Studio 0.9.1. If this is happening to you, please try uninstalling Studio 0.9.1 and reinstalling it. We are aware of the bug and a fix will be available soon. Please reach out to us if you experience any other related issues.


Dynamo for Revit
- Batch placement of adaptive components : Huge improvements to the speed and reliability of placing large numbers of adaptive components. Note that the nodes now expect lists of lists as inputs, so you may have to update your 9.0 graphs.

## Instrumentation ##
Dynamo contains an instrumentation system that anonymously reports usage data to the Dynamo team. This data will be used to enhance the usability of the product. Aggregated summaries of the data will be shared back with the Dynamo community.

An example of the data communicated is:

"DateTime: 2013-08-22 19:17:21, AppIdent: Dynamo, Tag: Heartbeat-Uptime-s, Data: MTMxMjQxLjY3MzAyMDg=, Priority: Info, SessionID: 3fd39f21-1c3f-4cf3-8cdd-f46ca5dde636, UserID: 2ac95f29-a912-49a8-8fb5-e2d287683d94"

The Data is Base64 encoded. For example, the data field above ('MTMxMjQxLjY3MzAyMDg=') decodes to: '131241.6730208' This represents the number of seconds that the instance of Dynamo has been running.

The UserID is randomly generated when the application is first run. The SessionID is randomly generated each time Dynamo is opened.
