## Develop ###
### Create a Node Library for Dynamo ###
If you're interested in developing a Node library for Dynamo, the easiest place to start is by browsing the [DynamoSamples](https://github.com/DynamoDS/DynamoSamples).  
These samples use the [Dynamo NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=DynamoVisualProgramming) which can be installed using the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio.

[Documentation of the Dynamo API via Fuget.org]( https://www.fuget.org/packages/DynamoVisualProgramming.Core/2.5.0.7432) with a searchable index of public API calls for core functionality in the dynamo nuget packages. *WIP*. 
#### note: link may change in the near future.

The [API Changes](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/API-Changes) document explains changes made to the Dynamo API with every version.

You can learn more about developing libraries for Dynamo on the [Dynamo wiki](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Zero-Touch-Plugin-Development) or the [Developer page](http://developer.dynamobim.org/).

### Build Dynamo from Source ###
You will need the following to build the latest Dynamo on Windows:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (any edition)
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 (included with Visual Studio 2019)
- [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)
- For runnning Dynamo tests within Visual Studio -[NUnit Test Adapter 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NUnitDevelopers.NUnitTestAdapter)

If you are working on legacy branches, you may need to install legacy .NET Framework versions through Visual Studio `Tools > Get Tools and Features...` or downloading from [the archive here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives).

The Dynamo user interface is Windows-only, but with some extra effort the Dynamo engine can be built for other platforms. [Directions for building Dynamo on Linux or OS X can be found here](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Dynamo-on-Linux,-Mac).  
Find more about how to build Dynamo at our [wiki](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki).


## Contribute ##

Dynamo is an open-source project and would be nothing without its community.  You can make suggestions or track and submit bugs via [Github issues](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/issues).  You can submit your own code to the Dynamo project via a Github [pull request](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Releases ##

See the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Release-Notes).
