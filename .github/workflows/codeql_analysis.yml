        # CodeQL supports the following values keywords for 'language': 'actions', 'c-cpp', 'csharp', 'go', 'java-kotlin', 'javascript-typescript', 'python', 'ruby', 'swift'
        # Use `c-cpp` to analyze code written in C, C++ or both
        # Use 'java-kotlin' to analyze code written in Java, Kotlin or both
        # Use 'javascript-typescript' to analyze code written in JavaScript, TypeScript or both
        # To learn more about changing the languages that are analyzed or customizing the build mode for your analysis,
        # see https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning.
        # If you are analyzing a compiled language, you can modify the 'build-mode' for that language to customize how
        # your codebase is analyzed, see https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages

        # Prefix the list here with "+" to use these queries and those in the config file.

        # For more details on CodeQL's query packs, refer to: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#using-queries-in-ql-packs

    # If the analyze step fails for one of the languages you are analyzing with
    # "We were unable to automatically build your code", modify the matrix above
    # to set the build mode to "manual" for that language. Then modify this step
    # to build your code.
