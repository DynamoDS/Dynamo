If a user commits a new method that is marked [IsVisibleInDynamoLibrary(true)], this indicates the addition of a new node.  Another way a user might indicate that they have added a new node is in the commit message. When a new node is added as part of a commit, verify if the appropriate documentation is included. This documentation includes at least 3 files that have the method name in them, but might have additional words. These files are a .dyn, .md, and .jpg. If these files are not part of the commit, alert the user that changes are required and they need to produce this documentation.
