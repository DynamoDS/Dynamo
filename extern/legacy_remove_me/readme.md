### What is this folder?

This folder contains binaries that we want to remove from dynamo, but at the current time cannot - without causing issues for Dynamo hosts.

Files meant to keep between Dynamo 2.7 to 2.9 are actually empty .txt files renamed .dll to avoid including any duplicate types which may be accidentally loaded. Those are removed as part of Dynamo 2.10.0. In the future we may still add binaries in this folder to amend to the regular build process.
