TuneUp allows you to see overall graph execution time, per-node execution time, execution time of groups, and other helpful information. With TuneUp, you can rerun all nodes, including ones that are normally skipped for optimization/caching during repeated runs of a graph. This enables you to compare the actual execution times between multiple runs.
