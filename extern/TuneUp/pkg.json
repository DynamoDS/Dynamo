TuneUp allows you to see overall graph execution time, per-node execution time, execution time of groups, and other helpful information. With TuneUp, you can rerun all nodes, including ones that are normally skipped for optimization/caching during repeated runs of a graph. This enables you to compare the actual execution times between multiple runs. Read more here: https://dynamobim.org/tuneup-extension-explore-your-node-and-graph-execution-times/. \r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n1. TuneUp does not work in a custom node workspace.\r\n2. TuneUp binaries are not semantically versioned and are not intended to be built on top of as an API. Do not treat these binaries like DynamoCore.",
