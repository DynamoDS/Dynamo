This engine behaves similarly to the default \u0022CPython3\u0022 engine, with some improvements:\r\n- Fixed overloaded method resolution.  \u200B\r\n- Improved generic method inference (don\u2019t need to specify generics as often).  \r\n- Define Python classes inheriting from .NET classes and interfaces.\u200B\r\n- Better extension method support, including Linq.  \u200B\r\n- Override .Net methods that have an \u0060out\u0060 or \u0060ref\u0060. \r\n \r\nPlease see our blog post for more detail: https://dynamobim.org/pythonnet3-a-new-dynamo-python-to-fix-everything","group":"","keywords":["pythonnet","python","python3"],"dependencies":[],"host_dependencies":[],"contents":"","engine_version":"3.3.0.6316","engine":"dynamo","engine_metadata":"","site_url":"https://dynamobim.org/","repository_url":"https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo","contains_binaries":true,"node_libraries":["DSPythonNet3Empty, Version=1.4.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"],"copyright_holder":"DynamoTeam","copyright_year":"2024"}
