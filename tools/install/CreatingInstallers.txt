Note: You need Inno Setup 5 in order to generate the installers.  Available for 
free here:
	http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

Tasks to create an install:

	1) Open the iss files and increment the version numbers. 
		These are under the Setup section as follows:
			[Setup]
			...
			AppVersion=0.3.0
			VersionInfoVersion=0.3.0
	2) Run the appropriate build scripts, CreateInstallers-RELEASE.bat or 
	   CreateInstallers-DEBUG.bat

Target directory for installers: (this dir)/Installers

Assumptions:

	1) You need to install Inno Setup 5 to run 
	2) The built binaries should be in ..\bin\Debug or ..\bin\Release.  That is, 
	one directory up in the bin directory.
	3) Those binaries will be copied to this directory, in the bin directory 
	before generating the installers.
