**Dynamo Docs**

Dynamo is a visual programming tool that aims to be accessible to non-programmers and programmers aike. It gives users the ability to visually script behavior,
define cutom pieces of logic, and script using various textual programming languages.

Dynamo is an open source tool, which means we need you to help us make it better. The Dynamo Docs will help you get familiar with the Dynamo API so that
you can create custom nodes and libraries.
