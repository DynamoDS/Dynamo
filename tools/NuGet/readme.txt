This folder contains scripts to build the Dynamo NuGet packages.

To update the packages to a new version:

1. Update the version numbers in each of the .nuspec files located in the DynamoVisualProgramming.xxx subfolders. These version numbers support semantic versioning. More info can be found at https://docs.nuget.org/create/versioning.
2. Run each of the Buildxxx scripts.
3. Post the generated packages to NuGet.
