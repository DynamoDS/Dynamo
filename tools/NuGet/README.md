# About

This folder contains scripts to build and publish the DynamoVisualProgramming NuGet packages into NuGet Gallery and Autodesk Artifactory.

## Instructions

To build NuGet packages locally, run BuildPackages.bat with parameters.

```bash
.\BuildPackages.bat param1 param2(optional)
```

*param1* should be the path where the nuspec files exist

*param2* should be the path where the dynamo binaries exist(optional, if it is not provided, it falls back to the `harvest` folder assuming dev has run the Install.sln)

See Example:

```bash
.\BuildPackages.bat "template-artifactory" "...\GitHub\Dynamo\src\DynamoInstall\harvest"
```

> Note: To build Install.sln solution you will need wix installed.

This command will wrap the dlls in the `harvest` folder into `nupkg` files and put them in current folder.

Alternatively, you can provide the second parameter as the path to your Dynamo binaries built with Release configuration, such as:

```bash
.\BuildPackages.bat "template-artifactory" "...\GitHub\Dynamo\bin\AnyCPU\Release"
```
The version is parameterized in the nuspec file and the parameter is set to the version number obtained in the `BuildPackages.bat` file. This is done using a `-properties` option while using the `nuget pack` command. The nuspecs from the original folders namely, `template-nuget` and `template-artifactory`. These are passed as command line arguments (which is what the %1 is) while invoking the `BuildPackages.bat` script from the `PostNuGetPackages.bat` and the `PostArtifactoryPackages.bat` files respectively.

To post them as pre-release packages into NuGet Gallery and Artifactory, skip the above step and run PostNugetPackages.bat or PostArtifactoryPackages.bat.
Supply the NuGet Gallery API Key as the first parameter and the Artifactory API Key as the second parameter for this batch file.
